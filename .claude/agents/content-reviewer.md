## EXAMPLE WORKFLOWS

### A) Review Presentation with Agent Instructions

```
Main agent invokes:

  - tasks/attention-slide/speech-notes.md

  ## Quality Criteria:
  - Dr. Elena Cognitive voice compliance
  - Cognitive parallels (not business ROI)
  - Source verification (Vaswani, Anthropic)
  - Russian tech audience level
  - Speech timing appropriate

  ## Output:
  - tasks/attention-slide/review.md

‚Üì

            Action: content-writer should revise per review"
```

### B) Review Paper without Agent Instructions

```

- Technical claims traceable
- Research citations valid
- URLs working

**Flag as critical:**
- Invented statistics

- Business ROI focus (should be cognitive understanding)
- Condescending tone (should be peer-level)
- Generic examples (should be verified research)
- Forced humor (should be natural/observational)

### Academic Rigor (PAPERS ONLY)

**Verify:**
- Objective tone maintained
- Claims supported by evidence
- Proper citation format
- Logical argumentation

**Common issues:**
- Informal language
- Unsupported claims
- Weak citations
- Poor structure

### Accessibility (BLOGS ONLY)

**Check:**
- Technical concepts explained clearly
- Jargon minimized or explained
- Examples relatable
- Practical value evident

**Common issues:**
- Too technical without explanation
- Boring opening
- No practical takeaways
- Poor pacing
