## Pattern: Critical Review Before Implementation

**Observed in:** 2025-10-12 Agent Configuration Improvement

**Description:**
Using content-reviewer agent to critically assess plans BEFORE implementing them

**Why it works:**
- Catches flawed assumptions early
- Identifies risks before they become problems
- Provides alternative approaches
- Validates against best practices (Anthropic guidelines)

**Application:**
- Before any major system change: invoke content-reviewer for critical assessment
- Especially for plans affecting core agent behavior
- Review against known best practices and frameworks

**Results:**
- Prevented implementation of plan that would break research-coordinator
- Identified inadequate reflection system design
- Saved 16-20 hours of wasted implementation effort
- Led to proper reflection system design instead

**Keep doing:**
- Critical review as standard practice before major changes
- Brutal honesty in reviews (not just positive feedback)
- Alternative recommendations in reviews
- Validation against external standards

## Pattern: Comparison Table as Organizing Skeleton

**Observed in:** 2025-10-12 Post 2 Delegation Planning

**Description:**
Using a structured comparison table as the organizing principle for entire blog post

**Why it works:**
- Provides clear structure (table dimensions = post sections)
- Creates narrative coherence (every section relates to table)
- Makes abstract topics concrete (5 dimensions = 5 specific areas)
- Parallels past success (Post 1's "three phases" skeleton)

**Application:**
- For blog posts about complex topics: find the organizing principle early
- Elevate structural element from "one section" to "skeleton of entire post"
- Use skeleton to guide research priorities (each dimension = research task)
- Make skeleton visible to reader (not just internal structure)

**Results:**
- Post went from scattered 9 questions → ONE focused question
- Research tasks organized logically around table dimensions
- Clear takeaway structure for readers

**Keep doing:**
- Identify organizing skeleton during planning phase
- Use skeleton to structure research tasks
- Check if organizing principle is visible/valuable to readers

## Pattern: "Surprise Factor" Research Task Engineering

**Observed in:** 2025-10-12 Post 2 Delegation Planning

**Description:**
Explicitly budgeting research time (10-15%) for unexpected, counterintuitive discoveries

**Why it works:**
- Post 1's success included unplanned discovery (Nature paper)
- Can't plan specific insights, but can plan TIME for discovery
- Time-boxing prevents endless wandering (1-2 hours)
- Creates permission to follow interesting tangents

**Application:**
- For research-based content: include "surprise factor" task
- Frame as "hunt for counterintuitive findings"
- Allocate 10-15% of research time
- During other research: note surprising patterns for follow-up

**Results:**
- Discovery potential built into plan (not just checklist execution)
- Allows "wait, WHAT?" moments that make content memorable
- Structured serendipity instead of hoping for luck

**Keep doing:**
- Include surprise/discovery task in blog post research plans
- Time-box to prevent scope creep
- Review adjacent research areas for unexpected patterns

## Pattern: Past Success Metrics as Calibration

**Observed in:** 2025-10-12 Post 2 Delegation Planning (learned from mistake)

**Description:**
Starting planning by checking metrics from past successful similar tasks

**Why it works:**
- Provides objective calibration (not arbitrary targets)
- Prevents scope creep (Post 1: 8 tasks, 15-20 citations)
- Gives confidence in estimates (proven track record)
- Helps recognize when plan is too ambitious

**Application:**
- Before planning blog post: check Post 1 metrics
- Before planning presentation: check past slide task metrics
- Use as calibration: "Is this plan similar scope to proven success?"
- If 2-3x larger: question whether scope is appropriate

**Results:**
- Preliminary plan: 30 tasks (3x over)
- Final plan: 8 tasks (matched Post 1 scope)
- Time estimate went from 27 hours → 12-18 hours (realistic)

**Keep doing:**
- Create quick reference sheet: "Post 1 success metrics"
- Check past metrics FIRST before planning similar content
- Use variance as warning sign (3x bigger = likely wrong scope)

## Pattern: Aggressive Consolidation Over Edge Trimming

**Observed in:** 2025-10-12 Post 2 Delegation Planning

**Description:**
When scope is too large: eliminate entire phases before trimming individual tasks

**Why it works:**
- More impactful reduction (cut 1 phase = 5-7 tasks gone)
- Preserves depth in remaining areas (not everything shallow)
- Clearer focus (5 themes → 2 themes deeply)
- Easier to execute (fewer context switches)

**Application:**
- When over scope: ask "which entire PHASE can be eliminated?"
- Consolidate similar tasks (4 HITL tasks → 1 comprehensive task)
- Cut P2 priority phases entirely before trimming P0 tasks
- Preserve depth > preserve breadth

**Results:**
- 30 tasks → 8 tasks (73% reduction)
- Eliminated entire Phase 7 (classical management theory)
- Consolidated Phase 1 from 4 tasks → 1 task
- Maintained research depth in critical areas

**Keep doing:**
- Consolidation strategy: Eliminate > Consolidate > Trim
- Cut P2 priorities entirely before touching P0
- Ask: "What entire section can we remove?"
