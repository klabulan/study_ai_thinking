## From 2025-10-12 Agent Configuration Review

### High Priority

1. **Implement Progressive Disclosure**
   - **What:** Restructure agent files for conditional section loading
   - **Benefit:** 40-60% context reduction without losing detail
   - **Effort:** 15-20 hours
   - **Risk:** Low (no content removed)
   - **Source:** Anthropic best practices + critical review
   - **Status:** Proposed

2. **Build Proper Memory/Learning System**
   - **What:** Structured memory with retrieval and feedback loops
   - **Benefit:** Continuous improvement, pattern reuse
   - **Effort:** 40-60 hours over 6 weeks
   - **Risk:** Medium (complex system)
   - **Source:** Anthropic long-horizon techniques
   - **Status:** In progress (reflection system created)

### Medium Priority

3. **Develop Helper Tools**
   - **What:** Tools to reduce instruction complexity
   - **Example:** AgentInstructionWriter tool for content-director
   - **Benefit:** 20-30% instruction reduction via better tools
   - **Effort:** 12 hours
   - **Status:** Proposed

### Low Priority

4. **Surgical Redundancy Fixes**
   - **What:** Remove only genuine, proven redundancy
   - **Benefit:** 5-8% safe reduction
   - **Effort:** 4-6 hours
   - **Status:** Partially implemented (Edit tool removed)

## Prioritization Criteria

**Implement when:**
- Clear evidence of problem (not speculation)
- Measurable benefit defined
- Risk acceptable
- Resources available

**Don't implement:**
- Solutions looking for problems
- Unvalidated assumptions
- High-risk, low-benefit changes
- Premature optimizations
