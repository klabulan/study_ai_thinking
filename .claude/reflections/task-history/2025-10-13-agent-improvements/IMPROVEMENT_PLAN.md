# Agent System & Process Improvement Plan

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Based on:** Tasks 1-8 Research Campaign Reflections
**Status:** Proposal - Requires Critical Review

---

## Executive Summary

This improvement plan addresses systematic issues identified in the Task 1-8 research campaign reflection, focusing on **preventing recurring mistakes** and **codifying successful patterns** rather than premature optimization.

**Core Philosophy:** Fix proven pain points, not speculative inefficiencies.

**Total Proposed Changes:** 8 improvements across 3 priority tiers
**Estimated Implementation:** 12-20 hours over 2-3 weeks
**Expected Impact:** 30-40% reduction in coordination errors, 20% faster task initiation

---

## 🔥 CRITICAL ISSUES (From Reflections)

### Issue #1: Main Agent Role Confusion
**Evidence:** Task 1-8 reflection (line 38-41)
> "Initial agent role confusion: Main agent tried to execute research directly instead of coordinating. User correction needed: 'run research agent!!! not make research by yourself!'"

**Pattern:** Common Mistakes doc shows this is recurring (3 instances documented)

**Impact:**
- Wasted effort (main agent doing work specialists should do)
- Lower quality (specialists are optimized for specific tasks)
- User frustration (requires manual correction)

**Root Cause:**
- CLAUDE.md has agent protocol but main agent misses it under task pressure
- No forcing function to check "should I delegate this?"
- Action bias - jumping to execution vs. orchestration

---

### Issue #2: Scope Creep in Planning
**Evidence:** Common Mistakes - "Dissertation Scope for Blog Post" (line 98-127)
> "Preliminary plan had 30 tasks, 20-27 hours, targeting 40-60 citations. User requirement: <10 tasks, similar to Post 1 scope."

**Impact:**
- 3x over-scope (30 vs 10 tasks)
- Wrong content type delivery (dissertation vs blog)
- Time waste (planning unusable scope)

**Root Cause:**
- content-director doesn't check past success metrics first
- "Comprehensive coverage" instinct overrides constraint adherence
- No calibration reference for content type scoping

---

### Issue #3: Self-Critique Violation
**Evidence:** Common Mistakes - "Main Agent Doing Specialist Work" (line 66-95)
> "Main agent let content-director self-critique (create plan_critique.md) instead of invoking content-reviewer. User correction: 'you act incorrect. you should only create plans, review and roast are @agent-content-reviewer tasks'"

**Impact:**
- Weaker quality control (self-critique less brutal than external)
- Role boundary violations
- Missed issues that reviewer would catch

**Root Cause:**
- Misunderstood "roast each" as "director roasts itself"
- No hard rule against self-critique
- Agent separation not enforced

---

### Issue #4: Over-Complex Agent Prompts
**Evidence:** Task 1-8 reflection (line 40)
> "Over-complex initial prompts: First research-intelligence-agent invocation was too detailed, got interrupted."

**Impact:**
- Agent invocation failures
- Wasted time restarting
- Cognitive load on main agent

**Root Cause:**
- No prompt length guidelines
- Trying to be "comprehensive" instead of "concise"
- No templates for common invocations

---

### Issue #5: Inconsistent Todo Tracking
**Evidence:** Task 1-8 reflection (line 236-238)
> "Todo tracking inconsistent: Todos updated at start, not maintained during parallel execution."

**Impact:**
- User can't see progress
- Lost shared context
- Looks like nothing is happening during long tasks

**Root Cause:**
- No protocol for updating todos during parallel work
- TodoWrite seen as "once at start" not "throughout task"

---

### Issue #6: No Discovery Budget
**Evidence:** Common Mistakes - "No Discovery Strategy" (line 200-227)
> "Preliminary plan was mechanical checklist: find X, find Y, find Z. No room for unexpected insights or serendipitous discoveries."

**Root Cause:**
- Planning mindset = checklist, not exploration
- No explicit time allocation for discovery
- "Surprise factor" task added post-mistake, not by default

---

## ✅ SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS TO CODIFY

### Success #1: Roast-Before-Implement
**Evidence:** Successful Strategies - "Critical Review Before Implementation" (line 7-36)
> "Prevented implementation of plan that would break research-coordinator. Saved 16-20 hours of wasted implementation effort."

**ROI:** 9 hours invested, 16-20 hours saved = 78% efficiency gain

**Currently:** Ad-hoc (user requested it)
**Should Be:** Mandatory protocol for all major changes

---

### Success #2: Parallel Execution
**Evidence:** Task 1-8 reflection (line 101-103)
> "Parallel execution saved ~8 hours: Instead of 11-15 hours sequential, completed in ~5-6 hours wall time."

**Impact:** 50% wall-time reduction, no quality degradation

**Currently:** Main agent knows to do this
**Should Be:** Explicitly called out in research planning

---

### Success #3: Past Metrics Calibration
**Evidence:** Successful Strategies - "Past Success Metrics as Calibration" (line 102-129)
> "Preliminary plan: 30 tasks (3x over). Final plan: 8 tasks (matched Post 1 scope)."

**Currently:** Not done by default
**Should Be:** First step in content-director planning

---

## 📋 IMPROVEMENT PROPOSALS

---

## 🚨 PRIORITY 1: FIX RECURRING FAILURES

### Improvement 1.1: Main Agent Role-Checking Protocol

**What:** Add decision tree to CLAUDE.md main agent section

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## BEFORE EXECUTING ANY TASK: ROLE CHECK

Ask: "Should I delegate this?"

Decision Tree:
┌─ Multi-hour research needed?
│  YES → Invoke research-coordinator OR research-intelligence-agent
│  NO  → Continue
│
┌─ Major content creation (slides/papers/blogs)?
│  YES → Invoke content-director for planning
│  NO  → Continue
│
┌─ Quality review needed?
│  YES → Invoke content-reviewer (NEVER self-critique)
│  NO  → Continue
│
┌─ Small edit (<10 lines, typo, formatting)?
│  YES → Do directly with Edit tool
│  NO  → Continue to next check

IF IN DOUBT: Delegate to specialist agent.
```

**Rationale:**
- Forcing function prevents role confusion
- Decision tree makes delegation obvious
- Catches 3 documented recurring mistakes

**Effort:** 1 hour (write + add to CLAUDE.md)
**Risk:** Low (clarification, not change)
**Expected Impact:** 80% reduction in role confusion errors

---

### Improvement 1.2: Content-Director Scope Calibration Reference

**What:** Create `/.claude/reference/content-type-scoping.md` with past success metrics

**Implementation:**
```markdown
# Content Type Scoping Reference

## Blog Post Scoping (Post 1 Success Formula)
- **Tasks:** 6-8 research tasks
- **Time:** 12-18 hours total
- **Citations:** 12-20 final (from 100+ collected)
- **Focus:** ONE central question deeply
- **Currency:** 75-80% from last 18 months
- **Discovery:** 10-15% time for surprise findings

## Presentation Slide Scoping (Past Success)
- **Per Task:** 2-4 hours including write-review-improve
- **Research:** 30-60 minutes per task
- **Analysis:** 2-3 pages extended
- **Speech:** 2-3 min minimum per slide

## Research Paper Scoping
- [TBD - add after first successful paper]

---

## DIRECTOR MANDATORY FIRST STEP

Before planning ANY content:
1. **Identify content type** (blog/presentation/paper)
2. **Check this reference** for successful scope
3. **Use metrics as calibration**
   - If plan is 2-3x larger → question scope
   - If plan is <50% metrics → might be too shallow
4. **Justify deviations** from reference explicitly
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents scope creep (30 tasks → 8 tasks)
- Objective calibration vs arbitrary planning
- "Check past metrics FIRST" becomes protocol

**Effort:** 2 hours (create reference + update director)
**Risk:** Low (guidance, not constraint)
**Expected Impact:** 90% reduction in scope creep errors

---

### Improvement 1.3: Agent Self-Critique Prevention

**What:** Add explicit rule to agent files preventing self-critique

**Implementation:**

In `content-director.md` (line 62-68 section):
```markdown
**❌ FORBIDDEN:**
- Calling other agents (no Task tool)
- Creating any project deliverables
- Executing the plan yourself
- Writing outside `/tasks/` directory
- Editing project files (no Edit tool - you plan, don't modify)
- **SELF-CRITIQUE: NEVER review your own plans** ← ADD THIS
  (Main agent invokes content-reviewer for all critiques)
```

In CLAUDE.md main agent section:
```markdown
## Agent Invocation Rules

**CRITICAL: NO SELF-CRITIQUE**
- content-director NEVER reviews own plans
- content-writer NEVER reviews own content
- Main agent ALWAYS invokes content-reviewer for quality checks
- "Roast/critique/review" = content-reviewer's job ONLY

Exception: None. Always use external reviewer.
```

**Rationale:**
- Hard rule prevents recurring mistake
- Makes role boundaries crystal clear
- External review is load-bearing for quality

**Effort:** 30 minutes (update 2 files)
**Risk:** None (clarification of existing intent)
**Expected Impact:** 100% elimination of self-critique errors

---

### Improvement 1.4: Agent Prompt Templates

**What:** Create `/.claude/templates/agent-prompts.md` with concise templates

**Implementation:**
```markdown
# Agent Invocation Prompt Templates

## Research-Intelligence-Agent (Simple Research)

**Concise Format (prefer this):**
```
description: "Research [topic]"
prompt: |
  Research: [1-2 sentence specific question]

  Requirements:
  - Sources: [academic/industry/both]
  - Minimum: [N sources]
  - Focus: [2-3 key aspects]

  Output: [file path]
```

**Avoid:** 500-line detailed specifications (causes interruptions)
**Maximum:** 100 lines for complex multi-part research

## Content-Writer (With Agent Instructions)

**Standard Format:**
```
description: "Write [deliverable]"
prompt: |
  EXECUTION CONTEXT:
  - Part of plan: tasks/[name]/plan.md
  - Step: [N]
  - Content type: [presentation/paper/blog]

  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  [Paste from tasks/[name]/agent-instructions-write.md]
```

**Keep:** Agent instructions file <200 lines
**Include:** Only essential context, not entire CLAUDE.md

## Content-Reviewer

**Standard Format:**
```
description: "Review [content]"
prompt: |
  EXECUTION CONTEXT:
  - Part of plan: tasks/[name]/plan.md
  - Step: [N]

  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  [Paste from tasks/[name]/agent-instructions-review.md]

  FILES TO REVIEW:
  - [path1]
  - [path2]
```

## Research-Coordinator

**Standard Format:**
```
description: "Coordinate research: [topic]"
prompt: |
  EXECUTION CONTEXT:
  - Part of plan: tasks/[name]/plan.md
  - Step: [N]

  AGENT INSTRUCTIONS:
  [Paste from tasks/[name]/agent-instructions-research.md]
```

---

## Guidelines

1. **Be concise** - agents work better with focused prompts
2. **Use agent-instructions files** - store complexity there, not in prompt
3. **Standard structure** - execution context + agent instructions
4. **Length limits** - <100 lines for most, <200 max for complex
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents over-complex prompts that cause failures
- Standardizes invocation patterns
- Reduces cognitive load on main agent

**Effort:** 2 hours (create templates)
**Risk:** Low (guidance, not enforcement)
**Expected Impact:** 70% reduction in agent invocation failures

---

## ⚡ PRIORITY 2: CODIFY SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS

### Improvement 2.1: Mandatory Roast-Before-Implement Protocol

**What:** Add protocol to CLAUDE.md for all major changes

**Implementation:**
```markdown
## Major System Changes Protocol

**BEFORE implementing any change affecting:**
- Agent configurations (.claude/agents/*.md)
- Core workflows (CLAUDE.md protocols)
- Process improvements (reflection-based changes)

**MANDATORY STEPS:**

1. **Create proposal** in tasks/[change-name]/
   - proposal.md with rationale, implementation, risks

2. **Invoke content-reviewer** for critical assessment:
   ```
   description: "Critically review [change] proposal"
   prompt: |
     ROASTING MODE: Be brutally honest.

     Review: tasks/[change-name]/proposal.md

     Assess:
     - Will this actually solve the problem?
     - What could go wrong?
     - Are we solving the right problem?
     - What are we missing?
     - Is this premature optimization?
     - Evidence supporting this change?

     Be skeptical. Find flaws. Suggest alternatives.
   ```

3. **Implement ONLY if review shows:**
   - Clear evidence of problem
   - Proposed solution addresses root cause
   - Acceptable risk/benefit ratio
   - No better alternatives identified

4. **Document decision** in .claude/reflections/improvements/

**ROI:** 9 hours review saved 16-20 hours wasted implementation (78% gain)
```

**Rationale:**
- Codifies proven success pattern
- Prevents implementing flawed plans
- Forces evidence-based decision making

**Effort:** 1 hour (add to CLAUDE.md)
**Risk:** None (adds safety net)
**Expected Impact:** Prevent 1-2 major implementation failures per month

---

### Improvement 2.2: Discovery Time Budgeting Standard

**What:** Add to content-director planning requirements

**Implementation:**

In `content-director.md` planning protocol section (after line 130):
```markdown
### Discovery Time Budget (MANDATORY)

For research-heavy content (blogs, papers):

**ALWAYS include "surprise factor" research task:**
- **Purpose:** Hunt for counterintuitive, unexpected findings
- **Time:** 10-15% of total research time
- **Position:** After main research tasks (Task N-1 or N)
- **Permission:** Explicit permission to follow tangents
- **Time-box:** Prevent endless wandering

**Example task structure:**
```markdown
### Task [N]: Surprise Factor Research
**Time:** 1.5-2 hours (10-15% of 12-15 hour research)
**Agent:** research-intelligence-agent

**Instructions:**
Hunt for counterintuitive findings in [topic area]:
- What contradicts conventional wisdom?
- What surprised experts?
- What's the opposite of what we'd expect?
- Any "wait, WHAT?" moments?

Permission to explore unexpected directions.
Time-boxed: 2 hours max.

**Output:** tasks/[name]/surprise-findings.md
```

**Rationale:**
- Post 1 success included unplanned discovery (Nature paper)
- Can't plan specific insights, but CAN plan time for discovery
- Enables "aha moments" that make content memorable
```

**Rationale:**
- Codifies successful pattern from Task 8
- Prevents purely mechanical checklists
- Structured serendipity

**Effort:** 1 hour (update content-director.md)
**Risk:** Low (adds discovery, doesn't constrain)
**Expected Impact:** 50% increase in "memorable insight" content

---

### Improvement 2.3: Parallel Execution Preference

**What:** Make parallel execution default for independent research

**Implementation:**

In `research-coordinator.md` execution section (after line 148):
```markdown
### PARALLEL EXECUTION PREFERENCE

**When planning research parts:**

1. **Identify dependencies:**
   ```
   Part 1: Foundation (must come first)
   Part 2: Application (depends on Part 1)
   Part 3: Examples (independent)
   Part 4: Alternatives (independent)
   Part 5: Validation (depends on Parts 2-4)
   ```

2. **Group independent parts:**
   ```
   Sequential Batch 1: Part 1 (foundation)
   Parallel Batch 1: Parts 2, 3, 4 (invoke simultaneously)
   Sequential Batch 2: Part 5 (validation)
   ```

3. **Invoke parallel batches:**
   ```
   Main agent invokes 3 research-intelligence-agents simultaneously
   (one for each of Parts 2, 3, 4)

   Expected speedup: ~50-70% wall time reduction
   No quality degradation if parts truly independent
   ```

**When to use parallel:**
- Research parts have no dependencies
- Each part self-contained
- Main agent can invoke multiple agents simultaneously

**When NOT to use parallel:**
- Parts depend on each other
- Sequential context needed
- Synthesis required between parts

**Proven success:** Tasks 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 (5 parallel) saved ~8 hours (50% speedup)
```

**Rationale:**
- Codifies proven success (50% time savings)
- Makes parallel default, not exception
- Clear guidance on when to use

**Effort:** 1 hour (update research-coordinator.md)
**Risk:** Low (already working successfully)
**Expected Impact:** 40% reduction in research wall time

---

## 🔧 PRIORITY 3: PROCESS REFINEMENTS

### Improvement 3.1: Todo Maintenance During Parallel Execution

**What:** Protocol for updating todos during long-running parallel tasks

**Implementation:**

Add to CLAUDE.md main agent section:
```markdown
## Todo Tracking During Parallel Execution

**When running multiple agents in parallel:**

1. **Initial setup:**
   ```
   TodoWrite: Create todos for all parallel tasks
   Example:
   - Research attention mechanisms (Task 2)
   - Research comparison framework (Task 3)
   - Research organizational examples (Task 4)
   All start as "pending"
   ```

2. **As each completes:**
   ```
   Immediately mark completed:
   TodoWrite: Mark "Research attention mechanisms" as completed

   Don't batch: Update after EACH completion, not at end
   ```

3. **User visibility:**
   - User sees progress in real-time
   - Reduces "is anything happening?" anxiety
   - Maintains shared context

**Rationale:** Parallel execution looks like "nothing happening" without updates
```

**Rationale:**
- Fixes documented issue (todos not maintained)
- Improves user experience
- Simple protocol addition

**Effort:** 30 minutes (add to CLAUDE.md)
**Risk:** None (clarification)
**Expected Impact:** Better user experience during long tasks

---

### Improvement 3.2: Content-Director Instruction File Size Limits

**What:** Guidance on agent-instructions file sizes

**Implementation:**

Add to `content-director.md` planning section (after line 270):
```markdown
## Agent Instruction File Size Guidelines

**Keep instructions concise and focused:**

- **content-writer instructions:** 100-150 lines
  - Context files to read
  - Task description
  - Requirements
  - Output location
  - Quality criteria

- **content-reviewer instructions:** 80-120 lines
  - Files to review
  - Quality criteria to focus on
  - Content type
  - Output location

- **research-coordinator instructions:** 100-150 lines
  - Research questions
  - Source requirements
  - Output location
  - Synthesis needs

**What to include:**
- Essential context
- Specific requirements
- Quality standards
- Output specifications

**What to omit:**
- Entire CLAUDE.md (agents already have access)
- Repetitive project overview
- Generic quality standards (use content-type specifics)
- Redundant context (link to files instead of copying)

**Rationale:**
- Agents work better with focused instructions
- Over-specification causes failures
- Reference by path, don't duplicate content
```

**Rationale:**
- Prevents over-complex agent instructions
- Complements prompt templates
- Practical guidance for content-director

**Effort:** 30 minutes (add to content-director.md)
**Risk:** Low (guidance, not enforcement)
**Expected Impact:** 30% reduction in agent instruction complexity

## ⚠️ RISKS & MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Over-Proceduralization
**What:** Too many protocols → rigid, slow process
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Implement only evidence-based fixes (no speculation)
- Review after 3 months: which protocols actually help?
- Remove protocols that don't show value

### Risk 2: Guidelines Ignored Under Pressure
**What:** Action bias overrides protocols when user wants fast results
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Make forcing functions hard to skip (decision trees, checklists)
- User education: "roast now = save time later"
- Track compliance to identify pressure points

### Risk 3: Coordination Overhead
**What:** More protocols = more coordination = slower start
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Priority 1 fixes save more time than they cost
- Templates reduce overhead (standardization)
- Monitor time-to-first-action metric

### Risk 4: Template Rigidity
**What:** Templates don't fit novel situations
**Likelihood:** Low
**Impact:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Templates are guidance, not constraints
- "Justify deviations" not "forbidden to deviate"
- Update templates when novel cases emerge

---

## 📈 MEASUREMENT PLAN

### Data Collection

**Task Reflections (continue existing):**
- Rich 400-word reflections per task
- Capture mistakes, successes, surprises
- File in `.claude/reflections/task-history/`

**Process Compliance Checks:**
- Did main agent use role-checking? (1.1)
- Did director check scope reference? (1.2)
- Were todos updated during parallel? (3.1)
- Was discovery task included? (2.2)

**Quarterly Reviews:**
- Review all task reflections
- Identify recurring patterns
- Measure against success criteria
- Update/remove protocols based on evidence

### Continuous Improvement Loop

```
Implement improvement
    ↓
Execute 3-5 tasks
    ↓
Capture reflections
    ↓
Analyze: Is problem solved?
    ↓
YES → Keep protocol, measure effectiveness
NO  → Revise or remove protocol
    ↓
Repeat
```

**Core Principle:** Evidence-based iteration, not one-time implementation.

---

## 🤔 QUESTIONS FOR REVIEW

1. **Are we solving the right problems?**
   - Evidence shows these are recurring issues
   - But are there bigger problems we're missing?

2. **Is Priority 1 truly critical?**
   - All have 3+ documented instances
   - But would they naturally decrease with experience?

3. **Are protocols the right solution?**
   - vs. better training
   - vs. tool improvements
   - vs. agent architectural changes

4. **What's the ROI threshold?**
   - How much implementation time justified per mistake prevented?
   - When does "process improvement" become process overhead?

5. **Should we batch or phase?**
   - All at once (faster) vs sequential (safer)
   - Risk of change fatigue?

---

## 💭 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES CONSIDERED

### Alternative 1: "Do Nothing, Learn Through Experience"
**Rationale:** Team will naturally improve with practice
**Rejected because:**
- Task 1-8 already showed 15 hours execution; mistakes still recurring
- User corrections needed (manual intervention shouldn't be required)
- Evidence shows patterns, not random noise

### Alternative 2: "Major Architectural Overhaul"
**Rationale:** Redesign agent system from scratch
**Rejected because:**
- Current system works well (200+ sources, all targets met)
- No evidence of architectural problems
- High risk, uncertain benefit

### Alternative 3: "Progressive Disclosure Implementation"
**Rationale:** Anthropic best practice for context reduction
**Rejected because:**
- No evidence of context problems yet
- Premature optimization
- 40-60% reduction claim unvalidated in our context

### Alternative 4: "Build Helper Tools"
**Rationale:** AgentInstructionWriter tool for content-director
**Rejected because:**
- Unclear if tool reduces complexity or just shifts it
- Templates (1.4) solve 80% of problem with 20% effort
- Can revisit after templates tested

---
