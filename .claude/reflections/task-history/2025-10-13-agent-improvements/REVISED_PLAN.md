# Agent System Improvement Plan - REVISED

**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Based on:** Original plan + Critical roast + Best practices
**Philosophy:** Fix root causes, not symptoms. Evidence-based iteration, not big-bang deployment.

---

## Executive Summary

**Core Problem:** Main agent cognitive overload causes recurring errors (role confusion, scope creep, inconsistent tracking).

**Original Plan Flaw:** Proposed 8 improvements in 3 weeks, treating symptoms with more protocols (adding to cognitive load).

**Revised Approach:**
- **Phase 1:** 3 high-impact improvements (6-8 hours, 2 weeks)
- **Measure:** 3-5 tasks with rigorous metrics
- **Phase 2:** Based on evidence, either iterate protocols OR implement architectural solution

**Key Insight:** We're not adding complexity. We're reducing decision burden through objective references and proven patterns.

---

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### The Real Problem: Cognitive Overload Under Time Pressure

**Main Agent Responsibilities:**
1. Interpret user request (understand intent)
2. Check CLAUDE.md protocols (4000+ lines)
3. Select appropriate agent (5 agents, 400-600 lines each)
4. Craft effective prompts (context + requirements)
5. Coordinate multiple agents (parallel execution)
6. Track progress (todos, intermediate results)
7. Verify quality (check outputs)
8. Report to user (summarize results)

**Under time pressure: This is impossible to do perfectly.**

**Evidence:**
- Role confusion: 3 instances in 10 tasks
- Scope creep: 30 tasks planned vs 8 needed
- Over-complex prompts: Agent invocation failures
- Inconsistent tracking: Todos not maintained

**The Pattern:** Errors correlate with:
- User urgency ("just do it")
- Task complexity (gray-zone decisions)
- Novel situations (no clear protocol match)
- Parallel coordination (juggling multiple agents)

---

## üöÄ PHASE 1: HIGH-IMPACT IMPROVEMENTS (Start Here)

**Goal:** Reduce cognitive load through objective references and proven patterns.

**Duration:** 2 weeks
**Time Investment:** 6-8 hours (realistic estimate)
**Expected Impact:** 40-50% reduction in documented error types

---

### Improvement 1.A: Scope Calibration Reference

**What:** Create objective reference file with past success metrics

**Evidence:**
- Scope creep: 30 tasks ‚Üí 8 tasks (73% over-planning)
- User correction needed: "<10 tasks, similar to Post 1 scope"
- content-director's "comprehensive coverage" instinct overrides constraints

**Root Cause:** No objective calibration ‚Üí subjective judgment ‚Üí scope creep

**Solution:** `/.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md`

```markdown
# Content Scoping Guide

## MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Check Past Success Metrics

Before planning ANY content, director must:
1. Identify content type
2. Check relevant section below
3. Use as calibration (not constraint)
4. Justify deviations explicitly

---

## Blog Post Success Formula (Post 1: Delegation)

**Scope:**
- **Central question:** ONE focused question deeply explored
- **Research tasks:** 6-8 tasks
- **Time budget:** 12-18 hours total
- **Source collection:** 100-200 sources reviewed
- **Final citations:** 12-20 (rigorously selected)

**Currency:**
- **Recency:** 75-80% from last 18 months
- **Foundation:** 20-25% classic/foundational

**Structure:**
- **Hook:** Paradox or surprising case (1 task, 5-6 hours)
- **Framework:** Core comparison/model (2-3 tasks, 4-6 hours)
- **Evidence:** Examples and validation (2-3 tasks, 4-6 hours)
- **Discovery:** Counterintuitive findings (1 task, 1.5-2 hours)

**Quality:**
- **Tier 1-2 sources:** 90%+ (academic + major industry)
- **Real examples:** Named organizations > anonymous
- **Verification:** 2+ independent sources for major claims

**Red Flags (Scope Creep Indicators):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More than 10 tasks ‚Üí Likely dissertation, not blog
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More than 20 hours ‚Üí Comprehensive survey, not focused post
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More than 25 citations ‚Üí Academic paper, not accessible blog
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple central questions ‚Üí Scattered, not focused

**When to deviate:**
- Topic genuinely requires more depth (justify why)
- Novel area with sparse research (more exploration needed)
- Framework development (not just application)

**Deviation template:**
> "This plan exceeds Post 1 metrics (X tasks vs 8, Y hours vs 15).
> Justification: [Specific reason why this topic requires more]
> Mitigation: [How we'll maintain focus despite larger scope]"

---

## Presentation Slide Success Formula (Tasks 1-6)

**Per-Slide Scope:**
- **Total time:** 2-4 hours (research + write + review + improve)
- **Research:** 30-60 minutes (if needed)
- **Extended analysis:** 2-3 pages with cognitive parallels
- **Speech notes:** 2-3 min minimum delivery time
- **Slide design:** Progressive disclosure, dense layout

**Quality:**
- **Dr. Elena voice:** 100% compliance (cognitive, not business focus)
- **Source verification:** Every statistic cited (academic + industry)
- **Cognitive parallels:** Human thinking analogies (verified research)
- **Russian tech audience:** Peer-level (not condescending)

**Red Flags:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More than 6 slides per task ‚Üí Over-scoping
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less than 2 min speech ‚Üí Too shallow
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Business ROI focus ‚Üí Wrong voice (should be cognitive)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unverified stats ‚Üí Quality issue

## Research Paper Success Formula

[To be added after first successful paper completion]

---

## Usage Protocol for content-director

**Step 1: Identify content type**
- Blog post ‚Üí Check Blog Post section
- Presentation ‚Üí Check Presentation section
- Paper ‚Üí Check Paper section

**Step 2: Compare plan against metrics**
```
My plan: X tasks, Y hours, Z citations
Reference: A tasks, B hours, C citations
Ratio: X/A, Y/B, Z/C
```

**Step 3: Decision rules**
- If ratio <0.5 ‚Üí Plan might be too shallow (verify)
- If ratio 0.5-1.5 ‚Üí Plan is calibrated (proceed)
- If ratio 1.5-2.5 ‚Üí Plan might be too broad (review)
- If ratio >2.5 ‚Üí Plan is over-scope (revise or justify)

**Step 4: Document in plan.md**
```markdown
## Scope Calibration Check

Content type: [Blog/Presentation/Paper]
Reference metrics: [X tasks, Y hours, Z citations]
This plan: [A tasks, B hours, C citations]
Ratio: [A/X, B/Y, C/Z]

Assessment: [Calibrated / Under-scope / Over-scope]
Justification: [If deviating from reference]
```

**Step 5: Main agent verification**
Main agent checks: "Did director document scope calibration check?"
If no: "Please check /.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md first"
```

**Implementation:**
1. Create `/.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md` with above content
2. Update `content-director.md` (line ~110, Context Analysis section):
   ```markdown
   ### Step 1: CONTEXT ANALYSIS

   1. **Identify content type**: Presentation / Paper / Blog
   2. **CHECK SCOPE REFERENCE FIRST**: /.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md ‚Üê ADD THIS
      - Compare against past success metrics
      - Use as calibration, not constraint
      - Document check in plan.md
   3. **Read project context**:
      - CLAUDE.md - project requirements
      [rest of existing content...]
   ```

3. Update CLAUDE.md main agent section (after line ~50):
   ```markdown
   ## Main Agent Verification Steps

   When content-director returns a plan:
   1. **Verify scope calibration:** Did plan.md include scope calibration check?
   2. If missing: Ask director to check /.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md
   3. If ratio >2.5: Question whether scope is appropriate before executing
   ```

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours
- Create reference file: 1.5h
- Update content-director.md: 0.5h
- Update CLAUDE.md: 0.5h
- Test with dummy plan: 0.5h

**Success Metrics:**
- **Leading:** 100% of plans include scope calibration check (next 5 plans)
- **Lagging:** Zero scope creep incidents requiring user correction (next 3 projects)

**Risk:** Low (guidance, not constraint)
**Confidence:** High (directly addresses documented problem)

---

### Improvement 1.B: Discovery Time Budget (Default Pattern)

**What:** Make "surprise factor" research a default component in research-heavy content

**Evidence:**
- Post 1 success included unplanned discovery (Nature paper)
- Task 8 (Surprise Factor) found 5 genuinely counterintuitive findings
- Mechanical checklists miss "aha moments"

**Root Cause:** Planning as checklist (find X, Y, Z) vs exploration (what's unexpected?)

**Solution:** Add discovery task as default in content-director planning

**Implementation:**

Update `content-director.md` (line ~145, after Step 2 CREATE DETAILED PLAN):

```markdown
### Discovery Task Budget (Research-Heavy Content)

**For blogs and papers with significant research (6+ hours):**

**INCLUDE discovery/surprise factor task:**
- Position: After main research tasks (Task N-1 or N)
- Time: 10-15% of total research time
- Permission: Explicit permission to follow tangents
- Time-box: Prevent endless wandering

**Task Template:**
```markdown
### Task [N]: Counterintuitive Findings & Surprises

**Purpose:** Hunt for unexpected insights that make content memorable

**Time Budget:** [X hours] (10-15% of [Y hour] research total)

**Research Questions:**
- What contradicts conventional wisdom in [topic]?
- What surprised domain experts?
- Any "wait, WHAT?" moments in recent research?
- What's the opposite of what we'd expect?

**Approach:**
- Review adjacent research areas
- Look for contradictory findings
- Check "surprises" sections in papers
- Explore edge cases and outliers

**Permission:** Follow interesting tangents (within time box)

**Output:** tasks/[name]/surprise-findings.md

**Success Criteria:**
- 3-5 counterintuitive findings identified
- Each backed by credible source
- Clear "surprise factor" (not just interesting, but unexpected)
```

**Graduation by Novelty:**
- **Low novelty** (well-studied topic): 5-10% discovery time
- **Medium novelty** (emerging area): 10-15% discovery time
- **High novelty** (bleeding edge): 15-25% discovery time

**Skip discovery task when:**
- Documentation/update tasks (no discovery potential)
- Timeline is extremely tight (with explicit justification)
- User explicitly requests targeted research only

**Default: Include unless justified reason to skip.**
```

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour
- Update content-director.md: 0.5h
- Create task template: 0.5h

**Success Metrics:**
- **Leading:** 90%+ of research plans include discovery task (next 5 plans)
- **Lagging:** 3-5 counterintuitive findings per project (subjective quality check)

**Risk:** Low (adds value, doesn't constrain)
**Confidence:** High (proven pattern from Task 8)

---

### Improvement 1.C: Graduated Roast-Before-Implement Protocol

**What:** Structured critical review for major changes, graduated by impact

**Evidence:**
- Roast cycle saved 16-20 hours (prevented flawed implementation)
- Caught breaking changes before they broke things
- Led to better solution (rich reflection system vs simple logging)

**Root Cause:** Action bias ("implement changes") ‚Üí skip validation ‚Üí flawed implementation

**Solution:** Graduated roast protocol (not everything "mandatory")

**Implementation:**

Add to CLAUDE.md (new section after "Quality Metrics"):

```markdown
## Major Changes Protocol: Roast-Before-Implement

**Before implementing changes affecting:**
- Agent configurations (.claude/agents/*.md)
- Core workflows (CLAUDE.md protocols)
- Process improvements (reflection-based)
- Project structure (file organization)

**GRADUATED APPROACH:**

### Small Changes (<2 hour implementation, low risk)
**Examples:** Fix typo in agent file, clarify existing protocol, add example

**Protocol:**
- ‚úÖ Implement directly
- ‚úÖ Document in git commit
- ‚ùå No roast required

---

### Medium Changes (2-8 hour implementation, medium risk)
**Examples:** Add new protocol section, modify agent responsibilities, new template

**Protocol:**
1. **Create proposal** in tasks/[change-name]/proposal.md
   - What's changing and why
   - Evidence of problem
   - Proposed solution
   - Implementation plan
   - Risks

2. **Self-review checklist:**
   - [ ] Clear evidence of problem? (not speculation)
   - [ ] Solution addresses root cause? (not symptom)
   - [ ] Acceptable risk/benefit ratio?
   - [ ] Could this break anything?
   - [ ] Are we solving right problem?

3. **Implement if checklist passes**
4. **Document** in .claude/reflections/improvements/

**Optional:** Request roast if uncertainty high

---

### Large Changes (>8 hour implementation, high risk)
**Examples:** Major architectural changes, new agent system, workflow overhaul

**Protocol: MANDATORY ROAST**

1. **Create detailed proposal** in tasks/[change-name]/
   - proposal.md (as above, more detailed)
   - rationale.md (evidence, alternatives considered)
   - implementation-plan.md (step-by-step)
   - risk-assessment.md (what could go wrong)

2. **Invoke content-reviewer for brutal assessment:**
   ```
   description: "Critical review: [change name]"
   prompt: |
     ROASTING MODE: Maximum brutality.

     Review: tasks/[change-name]/proposal.md

     Questions to answer:
     1. Will this ACTUALLY solve the stated problem?
     2. What could go wrong? (worst-case scenarios)
     3. Are we solving the RIGHT problem?
     4. What are we MISSING?
     5. Is this premature optimization?
     6. What's the EVIDENCE supporting this?
     7. What ALTERNATIVES should we consider?
     8. Will this be followed under pressure? (if protocol)
     9. Time estimate realistic? (check planning fallacy)
     10. What's the simplest version that could work?

     Be skeptical. Find flaws. Suggest alternatives.
     Rate: [Critical Issues] / [High-Impact Issues] / [Polish Issues]
     Recommend: APPROVE / REVISE / REJECT / ALTERNATIVES
   ```

3. **Implement ONLY if review shows:**
   - ‚úÖ Clear evidence of problem
   - ‚úÖ Solution addresses root cause
   - ‚úÖ Acceptable risk/benefit
   - ‚úÖ No better alternatives
   - ‚úÖ Critical issues resolved

4. **If review finds critical issues:**
   - Revise proposal
   - Re-roast (can be lighter review)
   - Document iteration

5. **Document decision** in .claude/reflections/improvements/
   - Original proposal
   - Roast findings
   - Revisions made
   - Final implementation
   - Results (measure after 3-5 uses)

---

## Accountability & Measurement

**Track implementation compliance:**
- Small changes: No tracking needed
- Medium changes: Log in improvements/ (did self-review pass?)
- Large changes: Full documentation required

**Measure outcomes:**
- Changes with roast: Success rate, time saved/wasted
- Changes without roast: Success rate, issues encountered
- Compare: Is roast worth the overhead?

**Quarterly review:**
- Which changes worked? (keep)
- Which changes failed? (remove)
- Was roast overhead worth it? (adjust thresholds)

---

## Philosophy

**Not about perfection, about risk management:**
- Small changes: Low risk, move fast
- Medium changes: Medium risk, self-check
- Large changes: High risk, get external validation

**ROI Evidence:**
- Roast cycle: 9 hours invested, 16-20 hours waste avoided = 78% gain
- Self-review: <30 min, catches obvious flaws
- No review: Fast but risky

**Adjust thresholds based on data, not dogma.**
```

**Time Estimate:** 1.5 hours
- Write protocol: 1h
- Add to CLAUDE.md: 0.5h

**Success Metrics:**
- **Leading:** 100% of large changes go through roast (next 6 months)
- **Lagging:** Zero "should have been roasted" failures (retroactive assessment)

**Risk:** Low (graduated approach, not blanket mandate)
**Confidence:** High (proven ROI from past experience)

---

## üìä MEASUREMENT PLAN

### Leading Indicators (Process Compliance)

**Measure after each task/plan:**

1. **Scope Calibration (1.A):**
   - Did plan.md include scope calibration check? (Y/N)
   - Was ratio calculated? (Y/N)
   - If over-scope (>2.5), was deviation justified? (Y/N/NA)

2. **Discovery Task (1.B):**
   - For research-heavy content, was discovery task included? (Y/N/NA)
   - Was time budget 10-15%? (Y/N/NA)
   - If skipped, was justification provided? (Y/N/NA)

3. **Roast Protocol (1.C):**
   - For medium/large changes, was appropriate protocol followed? (Y/N/NA)
   - For large changes, was roast conducted? (Y/N/NA)

**Target:** 90%+ compliance within 5 uses

---

### Lagging Indicators (Outcomes)

**Measure after 3-5 tasks/projects:**

1. **Scope Creep:**
   - User corrections for scope issues: [count]
   - Plans requiring major revision: [count]
   - Target: Zero scope creep incidents

2. **Discovery Quality:**
   - Counterintuitive findings per project: [count]
   - User feedback on "aha moments": [qualitative]
   - Target: 3-5 surprising findings per project

3. **Change Success:**
   - Changes with roast: Success rate [%], issues [count]
   - Changes without roast: Success rate [%], issues [count]
   - Target: <10% failure rate for roasted changes

4. **Overall:**
   - User corrections per task: [count]
   - Task completion time: [hours] (adjust for complexity)
   - Target: 30-40% reduction in documented error types

---

### Measurement Process

**After each task:**
1. Quick compliance check (5 min)
   - Did we follow new protocols?
   - Which worked well, which felt like friction?

2. Log in task reflection (existing process)
   - Note protocol usage
   - Note any issues or benefits

**After 5 tasks (Week 4-5):**
1. Aggregate metrics
2. Analyze patterns
3. Decision point:
   - **If working well:** Proceed to Phase 2 (next improvements)
   - **If mixed results:** Iterate Phase 1 (revise protocols)
   - **If not working:** Root cause analysis (why not? different approach?)

**Quarterly review (3 months):**
1. Full effectiveness analysis
2. Keep what works, remove what doesn't
3. Adjust thresholds, update guidelines

---

## ‚ö° PHASE 2: DECISION POINT (Week 5-6)

**After measuring Phase 1 effectiveness, choose path:**

### Path A: Iterate Protocols (If Phase 1 showed improvement)

**Next improvements:**
1. **Role-Checking with Time Heuristics**
   - Decision tree + time-based rules (>30 min = delegate)
   - Gray-zone guidance (when uncertain, delegate)
   - Tool-level prompts (not just documentation)

2. **Parallel Execution Preference**
   - Codify proven pattern (50% time savings)
   - Independence validation step
   - Clear guidance in research-coordinator

**Time:** 3-4 hours
**Measure:** Another 3-5 tasks

---

### Path B: Architectural Solution (If cognitive overload persists)

**Create Task Orchestrator Agent:**

```
User Request
    ‚Üì
Main Agent (Human-Facing)
    ‚Üì
Task Orchestrator (Coordination Specialist) ‚Üê NEW
    ‚Üì
Specialist Agents (director, writer, reviewer, coordinator)
```

**Task Orchestrator responsibilities:**
- Check protocols (has time, not under pressure)
- Apply decision trees (dedicated role)
- Select appropriate agents (knows all agents deeply)
- Craft effective prompts (can use templates, not rushed)
- Track todos (not distracted by content)
- Coordinate multi-agent workflows (primary job)

**Main Agent responsibilities (simplified):**
- Understand user intent (high-level)
- Invoke orchestrator with clear request
- Verify final quality (outcome check)
- Report to user (summary)

**Why this solves root cause:**
- Distributes cognitive load
- Orchestrator not under user time pressure
- Role confusion impossible (orchestrator's job)
- Gray-zone decisions handled by specialist

**Trade-off:**
- Additional architectural layer
- More complex system
- But: Solves root cause permanently

**Time:** 12-16 hours (full agent design + implementation)
**Decision:** Based on Phase 1 evidence

---

### Path C: Accept Current State (If Phase 1 solved most issues)

**If Phase 1 improvements reduced errors by 60-70%:**
- Remaining errors might be acceptable
- Marginal improvements not worth complexity
- Focus on other priorities

**Continue:**
- Quarterly reviews
- Reflection system
- Incremental refinements

---

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 1 Success = Proceed to Phase 2

**Quantitative:**
- ‚úÖ 90%+ protocol compliance (leading indicators)
- ‚úÖ Zero scope creep incidents (lagging)
- ‚úÖ 3-5 discovery findings per project (lagging)
- ‚úÖ 30-40% reduction in user corrections (lagging)

**Qualitative:**
- ‚úÖ Protocols feel helpful, not burdensome
- ‚úÖ Main agent cognitive load noticeably reduced
- ‚úÖ User satisfaction improved

**If targets met:** Phase 1 successful, proceed to Phase 2
**If partially met:** Iterate Phase 1 protocols
**If not met:** Re-analyze root cause, different approach

---

### Ultimate Success = Sustainable Improvement

**6-month horizon:**
- Documented error types reduced by 60-80%
- Protocols followed consistently (not just initially)
- Team operates smoothly without constant user corrections
- Quality maintained or improved
- Process not overly burdensome

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

### 1. Protocol Proliferation
**Don't:** Add more and more protocols over time
**Do:** Remove protocols that don't show value (quarterly review)

### 2. Mandatory Everything
**Don't:** Make every guideline "mandatory"
**Do:** Use graduated approach (default, recommended, required)

### 3. Documentation Theater
**Don't:** Create protocols that look good but aren't followed
**Do:** Measure compliance, understand why skipped, iterate

### 4. Ignoring Friction
**Don't:** "Protocols are good, team should just follow them"
**Do:** Listen to friction points, reduce unnecessary overhead

### 5. Solution Attachment
**Don't:** Defend protocols because of implementation time invested
**Do:** Kill protocols that don't work, regardless of sunk cost

## üé¨ CONCLUSION

**This revised plan:**
- ‚úÖ Focuses on root cause (cognitive overload)
- ‚úÖ Starts small (3 improvements, not 8)
- ‚úÖ Uses realistic estimates (no planning fallacy)
- ‚úÖ Measures rigorously (leading + lagging)
- ‚úÖ Iterates based on evidence (not big-bang)
- ‚úÖ Has architectural option (if protocols insufficient)
- ‚úÖ Graduates approach (not everything mandatory)
- ‚úÖ Manages change fatigue (phased implementation)

**Next steps:**
1. User approval of revised plan
2. Week 1: Implement Phase 1 (6-8 hours)
3. Week 2-4: Execute 3-5 tasks, measure effectiveness
4. Week 5: Analyze data, decide Phase 2 path
5. Week 6+: Implement Phase 2 OR celebrate success

**Philosophy:** Ship small, measure rigorously, iterate based on evidence. Don't get attached to solutions; get attached to solving problems.

---

**Remember:** The best plan is the one that actually gets implemented and measured. Perfect is the enemy of good. Let's solve real problems, not create impressive documentation.
