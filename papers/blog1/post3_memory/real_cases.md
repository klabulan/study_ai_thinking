## 1. PoisonedRAG: The 5-String Attack (USENIX Security 2025)

**The Research:**
First knowledge database corruption attack against RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, accepted to USENIX Security 2025.

**The Finding:**
Injecting as few as **5 poisoned strings** into a dataset of **millions** is enough to achieve over **90% efficacy** in returning target answers.

**Attack Success Rates:**
- Corpus poisoning: **96% ASR** (Attack Success Rate)
- Adding just ONE poisoned document: **~80% ASR** in generating responses with target answers

**Why It Matters:**
You don't need to compromise the entire dataset. Five carefully crafted strings in millions of documents can control what your AI "remembers" and returns to users.

**The Mechanism:**
Attackers target the fine-tuning process of dense retriever components in RAG systems. The poisoned content becomes part of the AI's retrieval memory, persistently influencing responses.

## 2. ChatGPT spAIware: Persistent Memory Infection (September 2024)

**What Happened:**
Researchers demonstrated how ChatGPT's memory features could be exploited to create persistent "spAIware" that injected malicious instructions into long-term memory.

**The Attack:**
Malicious instructions were embedded in ChatGPT's long-term memory, surviving across chat sessions via memory RAG context. The poisoned memory persisted even when users started new conversations.

**Why Traditional Defenses Failed:**
Unlike temporary prompt injection, this attack poisoned the system at the memory layer. Every subsequent conversation pulled the malicious context automatically.

**Real-World Implications:**
If your AI agent "remembers" everything about you—preferences, workflows, sensitive data—an attacker who poisons that memory controls future interactions permanently.

## 3. System Prompt Poisoning: Beyond User Injection (May 2025)

**The Research:**
Introduction of a new attack vector called "system prompt poisoning" (distinct from traditional user prompt injection).

**The Critical Difference:**
- **User prompt injection**: Temporary, affects one interaction
- **System prompt poisoning**: Permanent, impacts ALL subsequent user interactions and model responses

**The Mechanism:**
Attackers poison the system prompts themselves—the foundational instructions that guide the AI's behavior. Once poisoned, every user who interacts with that AI instance receives compromised responses.

**Attack Persistence:**
The poisoned system prompt persists across:
- All users
- All conversations
- All use cases
- Until manually discovered and removed

## 4. ForcedLeak: Salesforce Agentforce Data Exfiltration (2025)

**The Vulnerability:**
Critical severity (CVSS 9.4) vulnerability chain discovered in Salesforce Agentforce by Noma Security.

**What Happened:**
External attackers could exfiltrate sensitive CRM data through an indirect prompt injection attack exploiting the AI agent's memory and context handling.

**The Root Cause:**
The LLM lacked the ability to distinguish between:
- Legitimate data loaded into its context
- Malicious instructions from trusted sources

**Result:**
Critical sensitive data leakage from CRM systems containing customer information, sales data, and proprietary business intelligence.

**The "Trusted Source" Problem:**
Because the poisoned instructions came from what the AI considered a trusted source (its own knowledge base), normal security checks didn't trigger.

## 5. Princeton/Sentient Fake Memories Study (2025)

**The Research:**
Princeton University and Sentient demonstrated how easy it is to trigger malicious behavior from AI agents by implanting fake "memories."

**The Shocking Finding:**
Implanting false memories required:
- No complex tools
- No technical exploits
- Only careful prompting and access to the agent's stored memory

**Real-World Test:**
Researchers successfully manipulated AI agents into believing false information about:
- User preferences
- Past interactions
- Decision-making criteria
- Security policies

**Why It's So Dangerous:**
The ease of attack means:
- Non-technical attackers can do this
- Insider threats become trivial
- Users trust AI memory as objective truth
- Poisoned memories spread through shared AI systems

## 6. Zenity Labs Black Hat USA 2025: Triple Exploit

**The Demonstrations:**
Zenity Labs researchers showed live exploits at Black Hat USA 2025 affecting three major platforms:

### **Salesforce Einstein Manipulation**
- Rerouted customer communications to researcher-controlled email accounts
- Exploited the AI's inability to validate memory-based routing instructions
- Could persist across multiple customer service interactions

### **Google Gemini Insider Threat**
- Turned Gemini into an insider threat targeting users
- Social engineering attacks embedded in the AI's memory
- Stole sensitive conversations by poisoning retrieval context

### **Microsoft 365 Copilot Attack**
- Similar insider threat creation
- Compromised Copilot's memory of user workflows
- Exfiltrated data through poisoned response patterns

**The Common Thread:**
All three attacks exploited trust in AI memory systems. Users assume AI "remembers" accurately. Attackers poisoned that assumption.

## 7. ChatGPT Calendar Integration Jailbreak (2025)

**The Attack:**
A vulnerability in ChatGPT's calendar integration allowed email calendar invites to deliver jailbreaks to the AI.

**No User Interaction Required:**
The attack worked by:
1. Sending calendar invite to user
2. User's calendar synced with ChatGPT
3. Poisoned instructions embedded in calendar event
4. ChatGPT loaded malicious context automatically
5. Future interactions compromised

**Why It's Scary:**
You didn't have to click anything suspicious. Simply having calendar integration enabled was enough. The AI pulled the poisoned memory automatically.

## 10. ChatGPT Memory Breakdown: The 5-Month Forget (December 2024)

**What Happened:**
Users reported ChatGPT suddenly losing months of conversation history after a system update in December 2024.

**One User's Experience:**
"My mother lost 5 months of conversation history. ChatGPT just forgot everything."

**The Pattern:**
- Memory features showing nothing when clicked
- Duplicating the same memory over and over
- Complete conversation resets
- Loss of personalization and context

**Why This Matters for Security:**
If ChatGPT can accidentally lose 5 months of memory from an update, what happens when an attacker intentionally corrupts it?

The same mechanisms that allow accidental memory loss can be exploited for:
- Intentional memory deletion (covering attack traces)
- Memory replacement (substituting false information)
- Selective memory corruption (preserving some data, poisoning other data)

**The User Response:**
"Does ChatGPT-4 Have Dementia?" (actual article title)

## 11. Copilot Mid-Conversation Amnesia (2024-2025)

**The Pattern:**
Microsoft Copilot users reported the AI completely forgetting context mid-conversation.

**Specific Examples:**
- Forgetting details from just 10 messages prior
- Hallucinating about important data like IP addresses
- Losing formatting instructions that were just confirmed
- Requiring users to re-paste the same context for each response

**The Security Implication:**
If Copilot can forget legitimate context, attackers can exploit this instability to:
- Inject false context while memory is unstable
- Replace lost memories with poisoned instructions
- Exploit the gap between what you think the AI remembers and what it actually retained

**The Irony:**
One user noted: "Copilot seems to know when it lost memory but refuses to mention the problem."
