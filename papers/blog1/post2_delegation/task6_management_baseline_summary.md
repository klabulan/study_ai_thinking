# Task 6: Management Delegation Baseline - Summary

## Purpose
Establish foundational contrast points showing how traditional human delegation differs from AI delegation. These 3 key citations provide just enough grounding to set up "this is how delegation normally works with humans" before demonstrating how AI breaks these assumptions.

## Three Foundational Citations for Contrast

### 1. Drucker's Principle-Based Delegation (1967)

**Source:** Drucker, P.F. (1967). *The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done*. Harper Business.

**Key Principle:**
> "An effective executive would ask which of the two or three tasks at the top of the list he himself was best suited to undertake. Then he concentrated on that task; the others he delegated."

**Delegation Decision Criteria:**
- **Skill matching**: Delegate only when someone else is better suited for the task
- **Personal strengths focus**: Manager keeps tasks aligned with unique capabilities
- **Resource consideration**: Ensure delegate has time and resources
- **Strength-based**: "It's about tapping into a person's strengths, not getting them to do your job for you"

**Contrast Point for AI:**
Traditional management assumes you **know** what skills the person has and can verify their capability. With AI, you don't know what it can actually do until you try - no resume, no interview, no track record.

### 2. Mintzberg's Resource Allocator Role (1973)

**Source:** Mintzberg, H. (1973). *The Nature of Managerial Work*. Harper & Row.

**Key Framework:**
The "Resource Allocator" is one of 10 managerial roles in the decisional category. Managers must:
- **Match skills to tasks**: "Assigning personnel to tasks based on their skills and the project's needs"
- **Identify capabilities**: "Managers should identify strengths and weaknesses and assign tasks aligned to employee skills"
- **Prevent bottlenecks**: Strategic allocation avoids organizational bottlenecks and burnout

**Core Assumption:**
> "A resource manager distributes project workload across people... This delegation practice helps avoid organizational bottlenecks and burnout."

**Contrast Point for AI:**
Mintzberg assumes managers can **assess and match** employee skills to tasks through observation and known capabilities. AI has no stable "skill inventory" - capabilities emerge through interaction, and you can't prevent "burnout" by redistributing workload.

### 3. HBR Strategic Delegation Framework (2024)

**Source:** Research: How to Delegate Decision-Making Strategically. *Harvard Business Review*, September 2024. https://hbr.org/2024/09/research-how-to-delegate-decision-making-strategically

**Modern Delegation Criteria:**

**What to Delegate:**
- Decisions with **positive outcomes** (bonuses, rewards)
- Tasks **within employee's wheelhouse** (existing responsibilities)
- Choices that **primarily affect the delegate** themselves

**What NOT to Delegate:**
- Decisions with **negative consequences** (layoffs, penalties)
- Tasks **outside expertise area** (lack legitimacy)
- Choices that **significantly impact colleagues**

**Trust Calibration Principle:**
> "Knowing when and when not to delegate may be even more important: Managers who can navigate this effectively can enjoy the benefits of delegation without paying an interpersonal price."

**Skill Assessment Approach:**
From companion HBR article (June 2024, "Learning to Delegate as a First-Time Manager"):
- Ask employees: "What kind of work makes you feel energized?"
- Identify: "What do you consider your greatest strengths?"
- Understand: "What makes you feel most accomplished?"
- Match delegation to individual's "strengths, goals, or career development plan"

**Impact Finding:**
Gallup study: CEOs who delegate effectively generate **33% higher revenue** by empowering employees and increasing productivity.

**Contrast Point for AI:**
HBR framework assumes you can **ask the delegate** about their strengths, preferences, and goals. AI can't tell you what it's good at or what energizes it. You can't calibrate trust through conversation - only through empirical testing.

## Summary Table: Traditional Delegation Assumptions

| Traditional Assumption | Drucker (1967) | Mintzberg (1973) | HBR (2024) |
|------------------------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Can assess skills beforehand** | ✓ Know who's best suited | ✓ Identify strengths/weaknesses | ✓ Ask about capabilities |
| **Stable skill inventory** | ✓ Focus on known strengths | ✓ Match skills to tasks | ✓ Align to expertise area |
| **Can verify through conversation** | ✓ Collaborative environment | ✓ Resource allocation planning | ✓ Ask what energizes them |
| **Delegate = relationship building** | ✓ Tap into strengths | ✓ Avoid burnout | ✓ Trust calibration |
| **Clear boundaries** | ✓ Delegate when others better | ✓ Within defined roles | ✓ Within wheelhouse |

**With AI, ALL these assumptions break down:**
- ❌ No skill assessment beforehand (must discover through use)
- ❌ No stable inventory (capabilities shift with context)
- ❌ No conversation verification (can't ask "are you good at this?")
- ❌ No relationship building (transactional, not developmental)
- ❌ No clear boundaries (AI might surprise you with unexpected capabilities)

## Usage in Blog Post

**Opening Hook Pattern:**
> "Drucker taught us to delegate based on knowing who's best suited for the task. Mintzberg showed how managers match skills to projects through careful observation. HBR's 2024 research confirms we still delegate by asking people about their strengths. But with AI, you can't ask. You can't observe. You don't know what it's good at until you try."

**Comparison Table Section:**
Use the summary table above to visually contrast traditional vs. AI delegation assumptions.

**Transition to AI Reality:**
> "These foundational management principles worked for 50+ years because humans have resumes, interviews, and conversations. AI has none of these. So how DO you delegate to something you can't interview, can't observe, and can't predict?"

## Research Time: 52 minutes

**Sources Quality:**
- ✅ Foundational classics (Drucker 1967, Mintzberg 1973)
- ✅ Recent application (HBR 2024)
- ✅ Academic credibility + practical relevance

**Scope Control:**
- ✅ Limited to 3 core citations (not comprehensive survey)
- ✅ Focused on decision criteria, trust, skill assessment
- ✅ Positioned as contrast points, not main argument

**Next Step:** Use these as grounding context in blog post to establish baseline before demonstrating how AI delegation requires entirely different mental models.
