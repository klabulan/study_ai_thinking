# Final Research Plan: AI Delegation & Management (REVISED)

**Post Context:** Blog post on AI delegation decision framework
**Mandatory Standard:** Every fact backed by scientific or respected industry sources with citations
**Target Scope:** Match Post 1 success formula (focused, current, surprising)

---

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

**Maximum 8-10 research tasks** (USER REQUIREMENT: <10 tasks)
**Target time:** 12-18 hours (not 20-27 hours)
**Target sources:** 20-30 sources → 12-18 final citations (not 85-120 → 40-60)
**2025 focus:** 75-80% of research on 2024-2025 studies/cases (not 40%)
**Discovery mindset:** Leave room for surprising findings, not comprehensive survey

---

## Research Philosophy: Focused Questions + Discovery Zones

Each task has:
1. **Core question** - what must be answered
2. **Expected sources** - where to look
3. **Discovery zone** - what unexpected findings would be valuable
4. **2025 anchor** - how this connects to "why now?"

**This is a blog post like Post 1, not an academic literature review.**

---

## Task 1: Opening Hook Case Study
**Priority: CRITICAL - Research this FIRST**
**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Core Question
Find ONE dramatic, well-documented AI delegation failure from 2024-2025 that demonstrates "followed best practices but failed because of delegation framework mismatch"

### Specific Requirements

**Must have:**
- 2024-2025 timeframe (ideally 2025)
- Named organization OR verified anonymous case with details
- Specific AI system and task
- Quantified impact (dollars, people, time, scale)
- Clear "followed best practices" element
- Paradox: what they did "right" actually made it worse
- Citeable source (published case study, incident report, investigative journalism)

**Ideal narrative structure:**
- "Company X deployed [AI system] for [task] across [scale]"
- "They followed best practices: [list]"
- "[Time period] later, [quantified bad outcome]"
- "Twist: [metric] actually IMPROVED, everyone was more confident"
- "What happened: [mechanism that sets up comparison table need]"

### Expected Sources
- Tech incident reports (Hacker News postmortem, company engineering blogs)
- Academic case studies (CHI, CSCW conference proceedings)
- Investigative tech journalism (Wired, Ars Technica, IEEE Spectrum)
- Industry reports with verified examples (Gartner, McKinsey, MIT)

### Discovery Zone
- Case where "more AI oversight" paradoxically caused worse outcomes
- Failure that occurred BECAUSE they treated AI like human employee
- Incident that exposed comparison table dimension no one anticipated

### 2025 Anchor
This must establish: "In 2025, [this failure pattern] forced companies to admit their delegation frameworks don't work for AI"

### Success Criteria
- Specific enough to visualize and retell
- Verified with citeable source
- Creates cognitive dissonance (following rules made it worse?)
- Naturally leads to comparison table need

---

## Task 2: HITL Reality Check
**Priority: HIGH**
**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Core Question
What do 2024-2025 studies show about HITL effectiveness, limitations, and scalability?

### Specific Requirements

**Find 2-3 domain examples showing:**
- Success rates: Where HITL demonstrably works (with numbers)
- Limitations: Where HITL creates bottlenecks or degrades
- Automation complacency: Evidence of supervision attention decay
- Scalability constraints: Why HITL doesn't solve organizational delegation

**Must include:**
- At least ONE medical or legal HITL case (high-stakes domains)
- Quantified outcomes (accuracy improvements, but also costs)
- 2024-2025 studies preferred (not just literature review of older work)
- Evidence supporting "HITL works tactically but fails strategically"

### Expected Sources
- 2024-2025 medical AI studies (Nature Medicine, JAMA, Communications Medicine)
- Legal tech research (Stanford CodeX, legal journals)
- Automation complacency: One classic citation (Parasuraman) + 2024-2025 application
- Human factors research (recent studies in Human Factors journal)

### Discovery Zone
- Surprising domain where HITL completely failed despite being "obvious choice"
- Counterintuitive finding: More HITL supervision → worse outcomes in certain contexts
- Evidence that HITL creates NEW failure modes (not just limits throughput)

### 2025 Anchor
"2024-2025 organizational deployments reveal: HITL succeeds at task level but creates strategic bottlenecks—here's the data"

### Success Criteria
- 2-3 concrete examples with citations
- Supports thesis: "HITL answers 'how to supervise' but not 'what to delegate'"
- Evidence feeds comparison table "Autonomy boundaries" dimension

---

## Task 3: Comparison Table Evidence (MOST IMPORTANT)
**Priority: CRITICAL - This IS the post**
**Time estimate:** 3-4 hours

### Core Question
For EACH dimension of the comparison table, find 1-2 studies or cases from 2024-2025 showing the empirical human vs AI difference

### Comparison Table Dimensions to Support

| Management Dimension | Human Employee | AI Agent | Evidence Needed |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Skill qualification** | Verifiable credentials | Probabilistic performance | Benchmark gaming studies, real-world vs test performance gaps |
| **Task understanding** | Clarifies ambiguity | Confidently misinterprets | Cases of AI confident errors, studies on calibration failure |
| **Error patterns** | Predictable failure modes | Black-box failures | AI error pattern studies, adversarial examples, capability cliffs |
| **Motivation/incentives** | Goals, feedback, career | N/A | Why RLHF differs from human learning, absence of intrinsic motivation |
| **Autonomy boundaries** | Negotiated, tested | Undefined, shifting | Cases where AI limits weren't known until crossed |

### Specific Requirements

**For each dimension:**
- 1-2 concrete examples with citations (not theoretical)
- Focus on 2024-2025 organizational experiences where possible
- Show the contrast: "With humans this works, with AI it fails because X"
- Prefer empirical studies over conceptual papers

**Sources to consolidate:**
- AI capability evaluations (where models actually perform vs marketing)
- Error pattern research (hallucinations, confident errors, edge cases)
- Benchmark gaming documentation (training on test sets)
- Human delegation theory (minimal—just enough for contrast)
- Real organizational failures showing each dimension

### Expected Sources
- AI evaluation papers (NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL for technical accuracy)
- Human-AI interaction research (CHI, CSCW for organizational contexts)
- AI safety research (interpretability, alignment papers)
- FAccT conference (fairness, accountability, transparency)
- 2024-2025 organizational case studies

### Discovery Zone
- **6th table dimension** we didn't anticipate (what else breaks?)
- Dimension where AI is BETTER than humans (inverts assumptions)
- Surprising finding: A "known" dimension doesn't actually matter in practice
- Evidence that hybrid approach (human + AI) creates NEW failure modes

### 2025 Anchor
"2024-2025 evaluations reveal: AI violates every assumption of human delegation—here's the empirical evidence across five dimensions"

### Success Criteria
- Every table dimension has 1-2 concrete citations
- Mix of academic research + real organizational examples
- Clear "this is different from humans" contrast for each
- Evidence is recent (75% from 2024-2025)
- Total: 8-12 sources (core of entire post)

## Task 4: Organizational Adaptation Examples
**Priority: HIGH**
**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours

### Core Question
What 2024-2025 organizations succeeded with AI delegation—and what failed? What practices correlated with outcomes?

### Specific Requirements

**Find:**
- 2-3 companies/teams that succeeded with AI delegation
- 2-3 that failed (beyond Task 1 opening hook)
- Specific practices that correlated with success
- What "successful" organizations did differently from "failed" ones

**For each example:**
- Named organization (if public) or verified anonymous case
- Specific AI system and workflow
- What delegation approach they used
- Measurable outcomes (efficiency, accuracy, or failure metrics)
- Key practices (what did they do that mattered?)

**Success pattern examples to look for:**
- Task decomposition + risk assessment practices
- AI capability testing on real samples (not benchmarks)
- Oversight protocols matched to task risk
- Team structures that worked

### Expected Sources
- Harvard Business Review case studies (2024-2025)
- MIT Sloan Management Review
- Organizational case study repositories (verified examples)
- Company engineering blogs (postmortems, "how we use AI" posts)
- CHI, CSCW practitioner case studies
- Industry reports (McKinsey, Gartner if well-sourced)

### Discovery Zone
- Company that succeeded by doing OPPOSITE of "best practices"
- Success pattern that contradicts conventional wisdom
- Failed organization that did "everything right" (exposes hidden dimension)
- Surprising practice that made disproportionate impact

### 2025 Anchor
"Companies that integrated AI successfully in 2024-2025 shared these patterns—here's what the failures missed"

### Success Criteria
- 4-6 verified organizational examples (mix success/failure)
- Clear patterns emerge (not just anecdotes)
- Feeds proposed three-stage framework
- At least half from 2024-2025

---

## Task 5: Three-Stage Framework Validation
**Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH**
**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours

### Core Question
Do 2024-2025 research and practice support the proposed three-stage delegation framework?

### Framework to Validate

**Stage 1: Task Decomposition & Risk Assessment**
- Find: Evidence that breaking tasks into atomic units improves AI delegation
- Find: Risk assessment frameworks (consequence × capability × verifiability)

**Stage 2: Capability Mapping**
- Find: Studies showing testing on representative samples beats benchmark reliance
- Find: Documentation of performance distribution matters (not just average)

**Stage 3: Oversight Protocol Design**
- Find: Taxonomy of oversight levels (HITL, human-on-the-loop, human-off-the-loop)
- Find: Evidence that matching oversight to risk improves outcomes

### Specific Requirements

**For each stage:**
- 1-2 citations supporting the practice
- Real examples of organizations using this approach
- Evidence it improves outcomes vs ad-hoc delegation

**Don't need:**
- Deep regulatory frameworks (too narrow)
- Technical logging systems (too detailed)
- Comprehensive oversight literature review

**Do need:**
- Practical validation this framework makes sense
- Examples showing each stage in action
- Enough evidence to recommend with confidence

### Expected Sources
- Human-AI collaboration research (practical frameworks)
- AI governance papers (oversight taxonomies)
- Organizational behavior (task decomposition research)
- Error attribution studies (how to assess when things fail)

### Discovery Zone
- Evidence that framework is WRONG (needs different stages)
- Surprising stage that organizations use but we didn't anticipate
- Order matters: doing stages out of sequence creates specific failures

### 2025 Anchor
"Organizations succeeding with AI in 2025 converge on this three-stage pattern—here's the validation"

### Success Criteria
- Each framework stage has research/practice support
- Framework feels actionable (not just theoretical)
- 3-5 sources total (enough validation, not comprehensive survey)

---

## Task 6: Management Theory Baseline (MINIMAL)
**Priority: LOW - Optional context only**
**Time estimate:** 1 hour maximum

### Core Question
Just enough classical management theory to establish "this is how delegation normally works with humans"

### Specific Requirements

**Find 2-3 foundational citations establishing:**
- How managers traditionally decide what to delegate
- Trust calibration in human delegation
- Skill assessment and verification for human employees

**Use as contrast points only:**
- "Drucker said delegation works when X, but with AI..."
- "Traditional management assumes Y, comparison table shows AI breaks this"

**Explicitly do NOT:**
- Survey 40 years of management science
- Deep dive into delegation frameworks
- Comprehensive review of organizational theory

**This task is about grounding, not comprehensiveness.**

### Expected Sources
- 1-2 classic management texts (Drucker, Mintzberg) for foundational principles
- 1 recent application showing these principles still used (2020+)

### Discovery Zone
- Evidence that classical delegation theory anticipated AI problems (surprisingly prescient)
- Management principle that transfers to AI better than expected

### 2025 Anchor
"For decades, delegation worked via [human framework]. In 2025, AI breaks every assumption—here's the contrast"

### Success Criteria
- Maximum 3 citations
- Used as context, not primary argument
- Enables clear "with humans vs with AI" contrasts
- Completes in 1 hour (if takes longer, cut scope)

---

## Task 7: 2025 AI Developments Context (NEW)
**Priority: HIGH - Establishes urgency**
**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours

### Core Question
What changed in 2024-2025 that makes AI delegation urgent NOW?

### Specific Requirements

**Find 3-5 developments creating urgency:**
- New AI capabilities in 2024-2025 (what can AI do now that it couldn't before?)
- Organizational AI adoption stats (how many companies deployed? at what scale?)
- Major failures or incidents in 2024-2025 (delegation gone wrong)
- Industry reports showing delegation becoming critical issue
- Regulatory pressure or compliance requirements emerging

**Create "why now?" framing:**
- What's different in 2025 vs 2023?
- Why can't organizations wait to figure this out?
- What risk does poor delegation create at current scale?

### Expected Sources
- 2025 industry reports (Gartner, McKinsey, Stanford AI Index)
- News coverage of major AI incidents (2024-2025)
- AI capability announcements (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini capabilities)
- Organizational adoption surveys (how many companies using AI agents?)

### Discovery Zone
- Unexpected 2025 development that changes delegation calculus
- Surprising stat about scale (e.g., "50% of Fortune 500 now use AI for X")
- Regulatory or legal development forcing delegation decisions
- Capability breakthrough that makes old delegation approaches obsolete

### 2025 Anchor
"In 2025, [specific development] means organizations can't afford to keep treating AI like human employees—the stakes are too high"

### Success Criteria
- Opens post with urgency ("this matters NOW")
- 3-5 specific 2024-2025 data points
- Reader can finish: "I need to read this because in 2025, ________"
- Creates stakes for delegation framework need

---

## Task 8: Surprise Factor Research (NEW)
**Priority: MEDIUM - Critical for engagement**
**Time estimate:** 1-2 hours

### Core Question
What counterintuitive findings challenge conventional wisdom about AI delegation?

### Specific Requirements

**Find 3-5 "wait, WHAT?" moments:**
- "Everyone thinks X, but 2025 research shows Y"
- "Company did [best practice] and it made things WORSE because..."
- "The #1 predictor of success wasn't [expected factor] but [surprising factor]"
- "Organizations that gave AI MORE autonomy had fewer failures—here's why"
- "The delegation framework that works is OPPOSITE of human delegation"

**Surprise types to hunt:**
- Inverted assumption (more supervision → worse outcomes in specific context)
- Hidden variable (success correlates with unexpected practice)
- Paradox (following best practice causes failure)
- Pattern recognition (this mirrors past mistake, e.g., factory automation 1980s)

**This task has NO pre-specified answers—permission to find ANYTHING counterintuitive.**

### Expected Sources
- Read widely across all other research tasks
- Look for findings that surprised YOU
- Cases where "obvious" approach failed
- Studies showing non-obvious correlations

### Discovery Zone
**This entire task IS the discovery zone.**

Look for:
- Results that contradict your assumptions
- Findings that would make readers skeptical ("that can't be right")
- Patterns that seem obvious in retrospect but weren't predicted
- Evidence that challenges Post 2 thesis (makes post stronger if acknowledged)

### 2025 Anchor
"2025 data reveals: [surprising finding that challenges conventional wisdom]"

### Success Criteria
- 3-5 genuinely counterintuitive findings with citations
- Each creates "wait, WHAT?" reaction
- Distributed throughout post as engagement hooks
- At least one challenges author's initial assumptions (good faith research)

## Cross-Cutting Research Standards

### Source Quality Hierarchy

**Tier 1 (Strongly prefer):**
- Peer-reviewed journals (Nature, Science, JAMA, top ML conferences)
- Well-designed empirical studies with replication

**Tier 2 (Acceptable):**
- Respected institutional research (MIT, Stanford, Harvard Business School)
- Industry research with transparent methodology (McKinsey, Gartner if well-sourced)
- Conference proceedings (CHI, CSCW, NeurIPS, ICLR)

**Tier 3 (Use sparingly, verify carefully):**
- Investigative journalism with verified sources (Wired, IEEE Spectrum, Ars Technica)
- Company postmortems with specific details (engineering blogs)
- Verified case studies (Harvard Business Review)

**Never:**
- Blogs without citations
- Marketing materials or vendor claims
- Unverified anecdotes
- "Studies show..." without naming study

### Citation Requirements

- Every factual claim needs a source
- Statistics need original research citation (trace to primary source)
- Case studies need verification (published study, official report, or detailed journalism)
- No invented examples—only real, citeable cases

### Recency Priority (75-80% target)

**Strongly prefer:**
- 2024-2025 studies (85% of citations if possible)

**Use foundational work only for:**
- Explaining mechanisms (Kahneman anchoring, Tversky)
- Drawing historical parallels (factory automation 1980s)
- Establishing contrast ("Drucker said X, but with AI...")

**Pre-2020 research should be <25% of citations**

### Domain Diversity

- Need examples from multiple domains (medical, legal, software, business)
- Avoid over-indexing on any single industry
- Show patterns across contexts (increases generalizability)
