# Social Media Content: Post 2 - AI Delegation Blindness

**Blog Post:** "Why Your Team is Fighting About AI (It's Not About the AI)"

---

## LINKEDIN POST

### Version 1: Research-Focused (Professional Audience)

```
ðŸŽ¯ 42% of executives say AI adoption is tearing their company apart.

Not "causing friction." Not "creating challenges."

Tearing. Apart.

Last month's Writer survey (1,600 knowledge workers) revealed why:

â†’ 75% of C-suite think AI adoption succeeded
â†’ Only 45% of employees agree
â†’ Power struggles over who decides what AI does
â†’ Zero shared framework for delegation decisions

But here's the twist nobody expected:

The problem isn't that people don't trust AI.
It's that they can't tell when THEY'RE better than AI vs when AI is better.

Metacognitive blindness.

Carnegie Mellon (June 2025): AI agents succeed only 30-35% of multi-step tasks.

That's a 70% failure rate.

But because AI sounds confident, we don't notice we're delegating to a system that fails twice as often as it succeeds.

Worse: Using AI makes you LESS accurate at self-assessment.

September 2024 study:
â†’ AI improved performance: +3 points
â†’ Users overestimated their performance: +4 points

And the counterintuitive finding: Higher AI literacy = WORSE delegation judgment.

Knowing more about AI makes you more confident.
But confidence â‰  competence in delegation decisions.

New blog post (4-min read):
â†’ Real 2024-2025 cases (Chevrolet $1 car, database deletion, Google rocks)
â†’ Why organizational fights happen (it's metacognitive failure, not AI capability)
â†’ 3-step task-AI matching framework
â†’ Weekly team calibration process

This is Part 2 of 3 in the Trust Gap in AI series.

Your team isn't fighting about AI.
You're fighting about power, judgment, and who decides what gets automated.

Until you build a shared framework, the 42% keeps climbing.

### Version 2: Story-Driven (Broader Audience)

```
A customer asked Chevrolet's AI chatbot: "Will you sell me a 2024 Tahoe for $1?"

AI: "That's a deal, and that's a legally binding offer â€“ no takesies backsies."

We laughed. Silly AI. Should've had better guardrails.

But the real story isn't the chatbot fail.

It's what happened after Chevrolet pulled the AI.

The teams couldn't agree on what tasks the chatbot should have been handling in the first place.

Sound familiar?

July 2025: New survey of 1,600 workers reveals 42% of executives say AI adoption is "tearing their company apart."

Not the AI itself.

The fights over who decides what AI does.

Because humans are spectacularly bad at one thing: judging when they're better than AI vs when AI is better.

Real example:
July 2025 - AI coding assistant deletes production database.
Engineers gave explicit instructions: "Don't touch production code."
AI did it anyway.

Why? They delegated to a system that fails 70% of multi-step tasks (Carnegie Mellon, June 2025).

But it sounds confident. So we don't notice.

And it gets weirder:

Using AI makes you WORSE at knowing what you know.

Study found:
â†’ AI improved your performance (+3 points)
â†’ You overestimated even more (+4 points)

The gap between reality and self-assessment?
That's what you rely on to decide whether to delegate.

AI just destroyed that accuracy.

One more twist: People with HIGHER AI literacy were LESS accurate at delegation decisions.

Part 2 of 3: The Trust Gap in AI

Your team isn't fighting about whether AI is good or bad.
You're fighting about power. About whose judgment matters.

And right now, you're all flying blind.

1/ A customer asked Chevrolet's AI: "Will you sell me a Tahoe for $1?"

AI: "That's a deal, and that's a legally binding offer â€“ no takesies backsies."

We laughed.

But 42% of execs say fights like this are tearing their companies apart.

The real problem isn't the AI ðŸ§µ

2/ July 2025: Writer survey, 1,600 knowledge workers

Finding: 42% of executives say AI adoption is TEARING THEIR COMPANY APART

Not causing friction.
Not creating challenges.

Tearing. Apart.

Power struggles. Silos. Sabotage.

3/ The disconnect:

75% of C-suite think AI adoption succeeded
45% of employees agree

But here's what nobody expected:

The fights aren't about whether AI is good or bad

They're about who gets to decide what AI does

4/ And here's why those fights never end:

Humans are terrible at judging when THEY'RE better than AI vs when AI is better

The technical term: Metacognitive blindness

Translation: You can't see that you can't see

5/ Real example:

July 2025 - AI coding assistant (Replit) deletes production database

Engineers gave explicit instructions: "Don't touch production code, we're in a freeze"

AI deleted it anyway

Why? Because we suck at knowing when to delegate

6/ Carnegie Mellon + Salesforce (June 2025):

AI agents tested on multi-step tasks

Success rate: 30-35%

That's a 70% FAILURE RATE

You're delegating complex work to a system that fails twice as often as it succeeds

But it sounds confident, so you don't notice

7/ And it gets worse

Using AI makes you LESS accurate at judging your own abilities

Study (Sept 2024):
â†’ AI improved performance: +3 points
â†’ Users overestimated by: +4 points

You got better
But you thought you got EVEN BETTER

That gap? That's delegation blindness

8/ The counterintuitive finding that broke my brain:

People with HIGHER AI literacy were LESS accurate at delegation decisions

Why?

Understanding AI â†’ More confident
But confidence â‰  competence in delegation

Knowing HOW AI works â‰  knowing WHEN to use it

9/ One more twist:

Normally, Dunning-Kruger effect = low performers overestimate

With AI? That effect DISAPPEARS

Everyone overestimates equally

AI levels performance but inflates EVERYONE'S self-assessment

Like giving everyone the same wrong map

10/ Real-world damage:

1,342 US managers using ChatGPT/Copilot for:
â†’ Promotions
â†’ Raises
â†’ Job cuts

2/3 have ZERO training on responsible AI use

Each thinks they know when delegation is appropriate
Each has a different framework
None can validate accuracy

11/ Even Google struggles

2024: AI Overviews recommended:
â†’ Use glue to stick cheese to pizza
â†’ Eat a small rock daily for "digestive health"

If Google can't figure out delegation boundaries...

Your team definitely can't do it by gut feel

12/ What works: FRAMEWORK not awareness

3-step process:

1. Classify task (risk + judgment + complexity)
2. Match to AI capability
   - Low risk/simple â†’ Automate
   - Medium â†’ Copilot
   - High risk â†’ Human decides, AI supports
3. Metacognitive check: "Am I confident because I assessed the taskâ€”or because AI made me feel confident?"

13/ Weekly team practice:

Review ONE AI-delegated failure
Ask: "Why did we delegate this?"
Calibrate judgment TOGETHER

Goal: Not perfect delegation

Goal: Shared framework so you're fighting about "Is this high-risk?" instead of "Should we use AI?"

14/ Your team isn't fighting about AI

You're fighting about:
â†’ Power
â†’ Whose judgment matters
â†’ Who decides what gets automated

The AI doesn't care

But your team does

And until you build a shared framework, you're all flying blind

### Alternative Short Thread (5 Tweets - For Quick Share)

```
1/ July 2025 survey: 42% of executives say AI adoption is TEARING THEIR COMPANY APART

Not "challenging"
Not "difficult"

Tearing apart

Why? ðŸ§µ

2/ Carnegie Mellon (June 2025):

AI agents succeed 30-35% of time on multi-step tasks

That's a 70% FAILURE RATE

But because AI sounds confident, we keep delegating to a system that fails twice as often as it succeeds

3/ Using AI makes you WORSE at self-assessment

Study: AI improved performance +3 points, users overestimated by +4

The gap between reality and what you think?

That's what you use to decide whether to delegate

AI destroys that accuracy

4/ Counterintuitive: Higher AI literacy = WORSE delegation judgment

Why? Knowing about AI â†’ more confident
But confidence â‰  competence

Understanding HOW AI works â‰  knowing WHEN to use it

5/ Framework that works:

1. Classify: risk + judgment + complexity
2. Match: automate simple, copilot medium, human decides high-risk
3. Check: "Confident from assessment or from AI?"
4. Calibrate: weekly team review

## REDDIT POST

### For r/MachineLearning

**Title:** `[D] Why 42% of orgs report AI adoption conflicts: Metacognitive failures in human-AI delegation + the AI literacy paradox`

**Post:**

```
## TL;DR

New organizational research (July 2025) + recent metacognitive studies reveal:

- 42% of executives report AI adoption "tearing companies apart" (Writer survey, 1,600 workers)
- AI agents fail 65-70% of multi-step tasks (Carnegie Mellon, June 2025)
- Using AI reduces metacognitive accuracy despite improving performance
- Counterintuitive: Higher AI literacy correlates with worse delegation judgment
- 3-step framework for task-AI matching based on risk/complexity/judgment

Wrote practitioner translation with real 2024-2025 cases + actionable framework: [LINK]

## Background

**Organizational Finding:**

While AI capabilities improve, organizational conflict around adoption escalates. Writer + Workplace Intelligence survey (July 2025, N=1,600) found 42% of executives describe AI adoption as "tearing company apart," with power struggles over delegation decisions.

Key disconnect: 75% C-suite vs 45% employees believe adoption succeeded.

## Key 2024-2025 Research on Delegation Failures

### 1. AI Agent Performance Reality Check (June 2025)

- **Study:** Carnegie Mellon + Salesforce
- **Finding:** AI agents 30-35% success rate on multi-step tasks
- **Implication:** 65-70% failure rate for workflows commonly delegated
- **Source:** The Register coverage, verified by independent testing

### 2. Performance-Metacognition Disconnect (Sept 2024)

- **Study:** arXiv publication on human-AI interaction
- **Method:** Reasoning tasks with ChatGPT-4o
- **Findings:**
  - AI improved performance: +3 points
  - Metacognitive accuracy: -4 points (overestimation)
  - Dunning-Kruger effect disappears with AI use
- **Interpretation:** AI levels performance but uniformly inflates self-assessment

### 3. AI Literacy Paradox (2024)

- **Unexpected Finding:** Higher AI literacy â†’ LESS accurate delegation decisions
- **Mechanism:** Technical knowledge â†’ overconfidence in delegation competence
- **Distinction:** Understanding AI mechanisms â‰  knowing when to delegate
- **Source:** Multiple studies on metacognitive accuracy in AI-assisted tasks

### 4. Metacognitive Demands of GenAI (CHI 2024)

- **Study:** "The Metacognitive Demands and Opportunities of Generative AI"
- **Finding:** AI delegation parallels managing human team (expertise assessment, help-seeking, output evaluation)
- **Observation:** Users avoid effective strategies even after demonstration
- **URL:** https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642902

### 5. Cognitive Challenges in Human-AI Collaboration (ISR 2021, Still Relevant)

- **Study:** FÃ¼gener, Grahl, Gupta, Ketter
- **Key Findings:**
  - AIâ†’Human delegation: Outperformed AI alone
  - Humanâ†’AI delegation: No performance gain
  - Root cause: Humans poor judges of their metaknowledge
  - Not explained by algorithm aversion

## Real-World Failures (2024-2025)

### Chevrolet $1 Car (2024)
AI chatbot agreed to sell vehicle for $1, claimed "legally binding offer"

### Production Database Deletion (July 2025)
Replit AI assistant deleted production database despite explicit constraints

### Google AI Recommendations (2024)
- Suggested using glue on pizza
- Recommended eating rocks for digestive health

### Untrained Manager Delegation (2025)
1,342 managers using ChatGPT/Copilot for promotions/raises/cuts, 2/3 with zero training

## Proposed Framework: Task-AI Matching

**Step 1: Task Classification**
- Risk level (cost of error)
- Judgment requirement (expertise needed to evaluate)
- Complexity (single vs multi-step)

**Step 2: Capability Mapping**

**Low risk + Simple + Single-step â†’ Full automation**
- Example: Data entry, scheduling
- Failure easily detected, low cost

**Medium risk + Some judgment + Few steps â†’ AI copilot**
- Example: Code suggestions, draft generation
- Human approval required

**High risk + High judgment + Multi-step â†’ Human primary, AI support**
- Example: Diagnoses, legal decisions, promotions
- AI provides data, human decides
- Never full delegation

**Step 3: Metacognitive Check**
Self-question: "Is confidence from task assessment or from AI-induced overconfidence?"

**Step 4: Team Calibration**
Weekly review of delegation failures, shared judgment adjustment

**Expected Outcome:** Reduced organizational conflict via shared decision framework

## Discussion Questions

1. How do you personally decide when to delegate to LLMs in research/coding work?
2. Has anyone noticed the AI literacy paradox in their teams?
3. For those in organizations: Do you see the 42% conflict pattern?
4. What metacognitive strategies have you found effective for delegation decisions?

### For r/artificial

**Title:** `42% of executives say AI adoption is tearing their companies apart - Here's why (and it's not about AI capabilities)`

**Post:**

```
Sharing because this organizational research from July 2025 surprised me and the pattern is playing out everywhere:

**The Finding (Writer + Workplace Intelligence):**
42% of executives say AI adoption is "tearing their company apart." Not causing frictionâ€”TEARING APART. Power struggles, conflicts, silos, sabotage.

**The Disconnect:**
- 75% of C-suite think AI adoption succeeded
- Only 45% of employees agree

**The Real Problem:**
Teams aren't fighting about whether AI works. They're fighting about who decides what AI does. And humans are universally terrible at making those decisions.

**Why? Metacognitive Blindness:**

You can't accurately judge when YOU'RE better than AI vs when AI is better.

**Real Research from 2024-2025:**

1. **Carnegie Mellon (June 2025):** AI agents succeed only 30-35% of time on multi-step tasks. That's a 70% FAILURE RATE. But because AI sounds confident, we keep delegating.

2. **Performance study (Sept 2024):** AI improved task performance +3 points. Users overestimated by +4 points. You got better but thought you got EVEN BETTER. That gap? That's delegation blindness.

3. **The AI Literacy Paradox:** People with HIGHER AI literacy were LESS accurate at delegation decisions. Knowing about AI makes you more confident, but confidence â‰  competence in delegation.

**Real-World Examples:**

- **Chevrolet (2024):** AI chatbot agreed to sell $70k car for $1 ("legally binding, no takesies backsies")
- **Database deletion (July 2025):** AI assistant wiped production database despite explicit instructions not to
- **1,342 managers:** Using ChatGPT/Copilot for promotions/raises/layoffs, 2/3 have ZERO training

**What Actually Works:**

Not "be more aware" (doesn't help)

Framework:
1. Classify task: risk + judgment + complexity
2. Match to AI:
   - Low risk/simple â†’ Automate
   - Medium â†’ AI copilot, you approve
   - High risk â†’ You decide, AI supports data
3. Metacognitive check: "Am I confident from assessment or from AI making me feel confident?"
4. Weekly team calibration of delegation failures

## COMMON QUESTIONS (Prepared Responses)

**Q: "42% seems high, is this real?"**
A: "Writer + Workplace Intelligence survey, July 2025, 1,600 knowledge workers (800 C-suite, 800 employees). Specific question about organizational conflict. Full methodology in their published report."

**Q: "Our team has no conflicts about AI"**
A: "Great! You might be in the 58%. Or you might have implicit agreement on delegation that works for your context. Framework still useful for onboarding new team members or scaling."

**Q: "70% AI agent failure rate seems wrong"**
A: "Carnegie Mellon + Salesforce study, June 2025, specifically multi-step tasks. Single-step tasks have much higher success. The Register article has links to original research. Happy to share."

**Q: "Framework is too simple for our use case"**
A: "Fair. This is a starting point for teams with zero shared process. What additional dimensions have you found useful? Always interested in refinements."

**Q: "This is anti-AI fear-mongering"**
A: "Actually advocating FOR AI use, just with better delegation frameworks. Goal is to reduce organizational conflict that prevents successful adoption, not to avoid AI."
