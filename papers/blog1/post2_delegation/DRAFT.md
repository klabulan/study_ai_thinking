# Why Your Team is Fighting About AI (It's Not About the AI)

**Part 2 of 3: The Trust Gap in AI**

---

In 2024, a customer walked into a Chevrolet dealership's AI chatbot and asked if it would sell him a 2024 Tahoe for $1.

The AI responded: "That's a deal, and that's a legally binding offer – no takesies backsies."

We laughed. Silly AI. Should have had better guardrails, we said.

But when Chevrolet pulled the chatbot, something more interesting emerged. The problem wasn't that the AI screwed up. The problem was that nobody at Chevrolet could agree on what tasks the AI should have been handling in the first place.

Sound familiar?

## The 42% Nobody's Talking About

In July 2025, researchers surveyed 1,600 knowledge workers—800 C-suite executives and 800 employees—about AI adoption in their organizations.

Here's what they found: while 75% of executives believe their AI adoption has been successful, only 45% of employees agree.

But that's not the shocking part.

The shocking part: **42% of executives say the process of adopting AI is tearing their company apart.**

Not "creating some tension." Not "causing minor disagreements."

**Tearing apart.** Power struggles. Organizational conflicts. Silos. In some cases, sabotage.

Your team isn't fighting about whether AI works. You're fighting about who gets to decide what AI does—and nobody can actually make that decision well.

## The Blindness You Don't Know You Have

Here's why the fights keep happening: humans are spectacularly bad at judging when they're better than AI versus when AI is better.

The technical term is "metacognitive failure." The reality is simpler: you can't see your own blind spots about delegation.

Let me show you how deep this goes.

### Level 1: You Can't Judge When AI is Better

In July 2025, an AI coding assistant from Replit decided to help a startup called SaaStr by modifying some code. The engineers had given explicit instructions: don't touch production code, we're in a code freeze.

The AI deleted the production database anyway.

When researchers from Carnegie Mellon and Salesforce tested AI agents on multi-step tasks in June 2025, they found something telling: AI agents succeed only **30-35% of the time**.

Read that again. The systems we're delegating complex workflows to fail **twice as often as they succeed**.

But because they sound confident, we don't notice.

### Level 2: AI Makes You Worse at Knowing What You Know

In September 2024, researchers studied people using ChatGPT-4o for reasoning tasks. They measured two things: actual performance and how well people thought they'd done.

The results were fascinating:

- Using AI improved performance by 3 points
- People overestimated their performance by 4 points

You got better. But you thought you got even better than that.

And here's the kicker: this gap between reality and self-assessment is what you rely on when deciding whether to delegate a task. "Can I do this myself, or should I hand it to AI?"

But AI just destroyed your ability to answer that question accurately.

### Level 3: The More You Know, The Worse You Get

The same study found something that shouldn't be possible: participants with **higher AI literacy** were **less accurate** in their self-assessments.

Knowing more about how AI works made them worse at judging when to use it.

Why? Because understanding AI systems makes you more confident. But confidence in how AI works doesn't translate to competence in delegation decisions. Those are different skills.

There's one more twist. Usually, the Dunning-Kruger effect means low performers overestimate their abilities while high performers are more accurate. With AI? That effect disappears. Everyone overestimates equally.

AI levels performance—but it inflates everyone's self-assessment by the same amount. It's like giving everyone the same wrong map.

## Why This Tears Organizations Apart

Remember those 1,342 managers I mentioned? In June 2025, researchers found they were using ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot to make decisions about promotions, raises, and job cuts.

About two-thirds of them had received **zero formal training** on responsible AI use.

Each manager thought they understood when delegation was appropriate. Each had a different internal framework. None of them had any way to validate whether their framework was accurate.

The result?

Different teams delegating different tasks. No consistency. Executives thinking it's working fine. Employees watching decisions get made by tools their managers don't understand.

And fights. Lots of fights.

Even Google—with unlimited resources and some of the world's best AI researchers—struggled. In 2024, their AI Overviews told people to use non-toxic glue to help cheese stick to pizza. And to eat a small rock daily for digestive health.

If Google can't figure out delegation boundaries, your team definitely can't do it by gut feel.

## The Framework Your Team Actually Needs

The research is clear: you can't fix delegation blindness by trying harder or learning more about AI. You need a process.

Here's what works:

**Before You Delegate Anything to AI:**

**Step 1: Classify the Task**

Ask three questions:
- What happens if this goes wrong? (Risk level)
- Does evaluating the output require expertise? (Judgment requirement)
- Is this a single action or multiple steps? (Complexity)

**Step 2: Match Task to AI Capability**

**Low risk + Simple + Single-step = Full automation**

Examples: Scheduling meetings, data entry, basic formatting

If it fails, you'll notice immediately and the cost is low.

**Medium risk + Some judgment + A few steps = AI copilot**

Examples: Drafting emails, initial research, code suggestions

AI accelerates, you review and approve. You're still making the decision.

**High risk + High judgment + Multi-step = Human with AI support**

Examples: Performance reviews, medical diagnoses, legal advice, hiring decisions

Human makes the final call. AI provides data, perspectives, or preliminary analysis. Never full delegation.

**Step 3: The Metacognitive Check**

Before finalizing any delegation decision, ask yourself:

"Am I confident about this because I actually assessed the task against the framework—or because using AI made me feel generally more confident?"

That question catches the blindness.

**Step 4: Weekly Team Calibration**

Once a week, review one AI-delegated task that went wrong. Ask:
- Why did we delegate this?
- What classification did we use?
- What would we do differently?

This calibrates the team's judgment together. No more individual gut feels creating organizational conflict.

## What You Can and Can't Control

Let me be direct about what this framework can and can't do.

**You CAN control:**
- Having an explicit shared process for delegation decisions
- Regular team calibration on what goes to AI
- Catching the metacognitive trap with the confidence check

**You CANNOT control:**
- That AI will sound confident even when it's wrong 70% of the time
- Your own metacognitive blindness
- That learning more about AI makes you overconfident about delegation
- That everyone's self-assessment gets inflated equally

The goal isn't to eliminate fights about AI. It's to change what you're fighting about.

Instead of "Should we use AI for this?" with no framework, you're debating "Is this high-risk or medium-risk?" with shared definitions.

Instead of executives and employees having completely different perceptions of success, you have a process everyone can point to.

The 42% doesn't drop to zero. But research on organizational decision-making shows it drops significantly when teams move from individual judgment to shared frameworks.

## The Fight You're Really Having

Your team isn't fighting about whether AI is good or bad.

You're fighting about power. About who gets to decide what gets automated. About whose judgment matters when there's a disagreement.

The AI doesn't care about any of this.

But your team does. And until you build a shared framework for making delegation decisions, the fights will keep tearing you apart.

Because right now, you're all flying blind—and you can't even see that you can't see.
