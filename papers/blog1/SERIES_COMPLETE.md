# Trust Gap in AI Series - COMPLETE AND READY FOR PUBLICATION

**Status:** ✅ ALL THREE POSTS READY

**Completion Date:** January 2025

**Total Word Count:** 3,451 words across 3 posts (4-5 minute reads each)

---

## Series Overview

A three-part blog series exploring metacognitive failures in human-AI interaction through the lens of **Dr. Elena Cognitive**—warm, practical, research-backed insights for real people.

### Core Theme
Humans consistently fail to recognize when AI systems compromise their judgment, autonomy, and security—not through AI capabilities, but through trust asymmetries we can't see.

### Common Thread Across All Posts
Process and frameworks beat awareness and good intentions. Each post provides evidence-based protocols, not generic "be more careful" advice.

---

## POST 1: Your AI is Making You More Biased (And You're Taking It With You)

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Location:** `papers/blog1/post1_bias/`

**Word Count:** 1,168 words (DRAFT_v2.md version)

**Hook:** McDonald's AI butter disaster (2024) + critical thinking spillover

**Core Research:**
- Nature Human Behaviour (Dec 2024): 15-25% bias amplification, 72 citations in 4 weeks
- Cognitive offloading study (2025): r = -0.68 with critical thinking
- 775 managers anchoring study (Feb 2025): Despite warnings, still biased

**Key Finding:**
AI doesn't just give you biased recommendations—you inherit those biases permanently and carry them into ALL tasks, not just AI-related ones.

**Actionable Protocol:**
5-minute pre-decision protocol achieves 20-40% bias reduction (vs 6.9% from awareness alone)

**Files Complete:**
- ✅ DRAFT_v2.md (revised per user feedback: less race/gender, funnier stories, critical thinking spillover)
- ✅ DRAFT.md (original version)
- ✅ POST_PLAN.md
- ✅ real_cases.md (9 verified 2024-2025 examples)
- ✅ social_media.md (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit)
- ✅ README.md

**Publication Ready:** YES

## POST 2: Why Your Team is Fighting About AI (It's Not About the AI)

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Location:** `papers/blog1/post2_delegation/`

**Word Count:** 1,185 words

**Hook:** Chevrolet $1 car chatbot deal (2024) + 42% organizational conflict

**Core Research:**
- Writer + Workplace Intelligence (July 2025): 42% executives say AI adoption "tearing companies apart"
- Carnegie Mellon (June 2025): AI agents fail 70% of multi-step tasks
- Performance-metacognition disconnect (Sept 2024): +3 performance but +4 overestimation

**Key Finding:**
Humans can't judge when they're better than AI vs when AI is better—delegation blindness causes organizational conflict, not AI capabilities.

**Actionable Framework:**
3-step task-AI matching (risk + judgment + complexity) + metacognitive check + weekly team calibration

**Files Complete:**
- ✅ DRAFT.md
- ✅ POST_PLAN.md
- ✅ real_cases.md (10 verified 2024-2025 examples)
- ✅ social_media.md (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit)
- ✅ README.md

**Publication Ready:** YES

## POST 3: Your AI Agent Remembers Everything. Someone Else is Editing Those Memories.

### Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Location:** `papers/blog1/post3_memory/`

**Word Count:** 1,098 words

**Hook:** ChatGPT 5-month memory loss (Dec 2024) + "Does ChatGPT-4 Have Dementia?" article

**Core Research:**
- PoisonedRAG (USENIX Security 2025): 5 strings in millions = 90% efficacy, 96% ASR
- ForcedLeak - Salesforce (2025): CVSS 9.4 critical vulnerability
- Zenity Labs Black Hat USA 2025: Triple platform exploit (Einstein, Gemini, Copilot)
- System prompt poisoning (May 2025): Affects ALL users permanently

**Key Finding:**
Memory poisoning attacks succeed 95%+ of the time with minimal effort—and you have a 6-18 month preparation window before widespread deployment.

**Actionable Defenses:**
5 OWASP-based critical defenses (LLM04, LLM08:2025): Source authentication, RAG Triad, segregation, anomaly detection, immutable logs

**Files Complete:**
- ✅ DRAFT.md
- ✅ POST_PLAN.md
- ✅ real_cases.md (11 verified 2024-2025 examples + OWASP defenses)
- ✅ social_media.md (LinkedIn, Twitter, Reddit)
- ✅ README.md

**Publication Ready:** YES
