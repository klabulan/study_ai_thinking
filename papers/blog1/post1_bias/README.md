## The 5-Minute Protocol (Core Takeaway)

**BEFORE AI (60 seconds):**
- Write initial thinking (3 sentences)
- Note confidence level
- Identify key factors

**DURING AI (2 minutes):**
- Ask AI to argue AGAINST your position
- Request 3 alternative perspectives
- Demand reasoning explanations

**AFTER AI (2 minutes):**
- Wait 10 minutes before deciding
- Cross-check one claim
- Ask: "Would I conclude this without AI?"

**Evidence:** 20-40% bias reduction (vs 6.9% from awareness alone)

## What's Different About This Post

Most AI bias content focuses on:
- ❌ AI's training biases (what we can't control)
- ❌ Generic "be aware" advice (proven ineffective)
- ❌ Fear-mongering or dismissal
- ❌ Theoretical discussions

This post focuses on:
- ✅ Bias amplification + inheritance (what affects YOU)
- ✅ Evidence-based protocols (20-40% improvement)
- ✅ Practical empowerment through process
- ✅ Real 2025 cases (relatable, concrete)
