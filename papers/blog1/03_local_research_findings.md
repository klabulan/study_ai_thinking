## THEME 2: Trust Asymmetry Mechanism - Local Findings

### 2.1 Trust Asymmetry in Cognitive Science Literature

**⚠️ LIMITED LOCAL EVIDENCE:**

**Trust Calibration Section Found (component_3, lines 340-353):**
- Trust Calibration Maturity Model (TCMM) confirmed
  - Source: arXiv 2503.15511
  - Five dimensions: Performance, Bias/Robustness, Transparency, Safety, Usability
- Rapid trust calibration through interpretability + uncertainty awareness (lines 356-361)
- Cognitive vs Emotional trust distinction (lines 363-369)

**BUT: "Trust Asymmetry" Phrase Found Once:**
- Line 300: "trust asymmetries between different models"
- **THIS IS ABOUT MODEL-TO-MODEL TRUST, NOT HUMAN-VS-AI MEMORY TRUST**

**❌ CRITICAL FINDING:**
The phrase "trust asymmetry" (humans question own memory but not AI memory) **does NOT appear in local research**.

**What Local Research Actually Shows:**
- Theory of Mind activation (lines 103-116) → anthropomorphization
- Erosion of critical skepticism (lines 183-188) → "less inclined to double-check AI"
- Poor mental models (lines 296-305) → trust calibration failures

**Interpretation:**
- The trust asymmetry framing appears to be OUR SYNTHESIS, not documented cognitive science terminology
- Related concepts exist (skepticism erosion, over-reliance) but not framed as "trust asymmetry"

**NEEDS WEB RESEARCH:** Verify if "trust asymmetry" is recognized cognitive science framing

---

### 2.2 Bias Inheritance and Trust Link

**✅ MECHANISM DOCUMENTED, ⚠️ TRUST LINK UNCLEAR:**

**Nature Paper Mechanisms (lines 15-49):**
1. **Bias Amplification:** AI amplifies biases more than humans do
2. **Compound Human-AI Bias:** Framework for how biases interact (line 28-36)
3. **Bias Inheritance:** Users replicate AI errors even after AI removed (line 38-45)

**Actual Mechanisms Mentioned:**
- **Anchoring bias** (lines 164-172): 775 managers study, AI recommendations create anchors
- **Confirmation bias** (lines 150-161): CHI 2025, users favor AI matching beliefs
- **Theory of Mind activation** (lines 103-116): Anthropomorphization → parasocial relationships
- **Skepticism erosion** (lines 183-188): Less inclined to double-check AI

**❌ TRUST NOT EXPLICITLY MENTIONED AS MECHANISM**

**Key Quote (line 156-159):**
"More inclined to trust AI when it aligned with initial diagnoses" - but this is confirmation bias, not trust asymmetry

**Interpretation:**
- Trust plays a role but is NOT the primary mechanism in Nature paper
- Actual mechanisms: Anchoring + Confirmation + ToM activation
- Trust appears to be correlate, not cause

**NEEDS WEB RESEARCH:** Read full Nature paper to verify if trust is explicit mechanism

---

### 2.3 Metacognitive Failure and Trust Link

**✅ MECHANISM DOCUMENTED, ⚠️ TRUST IS SECONDARY:**

**Delegation Research (lines 196-227):**

**Core Finding (line 199-205):**
- Performance improves when **AI delegates to humans**
- Does NOT improve when **humans delegate to AI**
- **Root cause:** "Humans lack metaknowledge - cannot assess own capabilities correctly"

**❌ CRITICAL:** Root cause is **METAKNOWLEDGE DEFICIT**, not trust asymmetry

**What Actually Helps (line 208-217):**
- Contextual information significantly improves delegation
- Self-efficacy and visual processing ability matter (line 220-226)
- AI knowledge gap (line 228-234) - users lack understanding of capabilities

**Trust Mentions:**
- Line 300: "trust asymmetries between different models" (model-to-model, not human-AI)
- Trust calibration section exists but doesn't link to delegation failures

**Interpretation:**
- Delegation failure is about **poor self-assessment** (metacognitive blindness)
- Trust may correlate but is NOT the mechanism
- Actual mechanism: Inability to judge own capabilities vs AI capabilities

**CONCLUSION:** Trust asymmetry is FORCED connection for metacognitive failure

---

### 2.4 Memory Poisoning and Trust Link

**✅ TRUST ASYMMETRY FITS PERFECTLY (But Not Documented Locally):**

**Memory Poisoning Evidence in Local Research:**
- CVE-2025-32711 mentioned (comprehensive report line 551)
- Lasso Security Top 10 threats (line 545)
- Memory poisoning in top 3 agentic threats

**❌ BUT: No cognitive mechanism explained in local research**

**What's MISSING from Local Research:**
- No explanation of WHY memory poisoning works
- No mention of trust asymmetry (questioning human memory vs AI memory)
- No cognitive science framing of the vulnerability

**Trust Asymmetry Logic (OUR SYNTHESIS):**
- Humans question own memory ("Did I lock the door?")
- Humans don't question AI memory (assume perfect recall)
- Asymmetry creates blindspot for poisoning

**Status:** This appears to be OUR INTERPRETATION, not documented research

**NEEDS WEB RESEARCH:**
- Princeton memory poisoning research (mentioned but not detailed)
- Cognitive mechanisms of memory poisoning vulnerability
- Trust dynamics in agent memory systems

## THEME 3: Mitigation Effectiveness - Local Findings

### 3.1 TCMM (Trust Calibration Maturity Model)

**✅ FULLY VERIFIED:**

**Source:** component_3, lines 342-353
**Citation:** arXiv 2503.15511 (March 2025)
**URL:** https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15511

**TCMM Framework:**
Five Dimensions of Analytic Maturity:
1. Performance Characterization
2. Bias & Robustness Quantification
3. Transparency
4. Safety & Security
5. Usability

**Purpose:** "Characterize and communicate AI system trustworthiness"

**Key Insight (lines 356-361):**
- Interpretability + uncertainty awareness enable rapid calibration
- Long-term interaction NOT necessary if AI shows what it knows/doesn't know

**⚠️ APPLICABILITY UNCLEAR:**
- Is this organizational or individual-level?
- Are these dimensions user-actionable or system design requirements?
- How to translate to personal trust calibration checklist?

**NEEDS WEB RESEARCH:** Full arXiv paper to determine applicability to individuals

### 3.2 Bias Mitigation Strategies

**✅ FOREWARNING INEFFECTIVENESS VERIFIED:**

**Source:** component_3, lines 537-544
**Citation:** SAGE Journals, 2025
**URL:** https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0272989X251346788

**Finding:** Forewarning decreased overall bias by only **6.9%**
**Critical:** "No bias was extinguished completely"

**❌ NO EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES DOCUMENTED IN LOCAL RESEARCH**

**What Local Research Shows:**
- Bias amplification happens (Nature paper)
- Anchoring and confirmation biases persist (lines 183-188)
- Forewarning doesn't work (6.9% reduction)

**What Local Research DOESN'T Show:**
- What DOES work to reduce bias?
- Validated mitigation strategies beyond forewarning?
- Effect sizes for any interventions?

**Paradox Noted (lines 174-180):**
"AI can reduce OR amplify anchoring" - positive potential exists but underinvestigated

**NEEDS WEB RESEARCH:**
- Effective debiasing interventions (2024-2025)
- Bias reduction strategies beyond forewarning
- Practical mitigation effect sizes

## CRITICAL ASSESSMENT: Trust Asymmetry as Unifying Mechanism

### Evidence FOR Trust as Connector:
1. ✅ Trust calibration research exists (TCMM)
2. ✅ Skepticism erosion documented ("less inclined to double-check")
3. ✅ Over-reliance patterns observed
4. ✅ Mental model failures lead to trust miscalibration

### Evidence AGAINST Trust as Primary Mechanism:

**For Bias Inheritance:**
- ❌ Nature paper mechanisms: Anchoring, confirmation, ToM - NOT trust asymmetry
- ❌ "Trust" mentioned as correlate, not cause
- ❌ Local research doesn't frame bias amplification as trust problem

**For Metacognitive Failure:**
- ❌ Root cause: "Lack of metaknowledge" (self-assessment failure)
- ❌ NOT described as trust asymmetry problem
- ❌ Solutions: Contextual information, AI knowledge - NOT trust calibration

**For Memory Poisoning:**
- ✅ Trust asymmetry WOULD explain vulnerability perfectly
- ❌ BUT: Not documented in local research
- ❌ This appears to be OUR SYNTHESIS, not research-backed framing

### CONCLUSION:

**Trust asymmetry is PARTIALLY FORCED as unifying mechanism.**

**Strength by Mechanism:**
1. **Memory Poisoning:** Trust asymmetry fits perfectly (10/10) BUT not documented
2. **Metacognitive Failure:** Trust is secondary to metaknowledge deficit (4/10)
3. **Bias Inheritance:** Trust is correlate, not primary mechanism (3/10)

**Overall Assessment:**
- Trust asymmetry is an INSIGHTFUL SYNTHESIS we've created
- It's NOT how existing research frames these problems
- Risk of forcing cognitive science onto unrelated issues (exact problem identified in final synthesis)

## WEB RESEARCH PRIORITIES (Ranked by Criticality)

### CRITICAL (Must Complete Before Proceeding):

1. **Verify Current Date & Timeline**
   - Resolve Jan 2025 vs Sept 2025 confusion
   - Establish CVE-2025-32711 actual timeline
   - Determine if we're 1 month or 9 months from Nature paper

2. **Trust Asymmetry Cognitive Science Validation**
   - Search: "trust asymmetry AI" "human vs AI trust"
   - Determine if this is recognized framing or our invention
   - Alternative: Find research that DOES support this framing

3. **10% Agent Identity Strategy Source**
   - Find Lasso Security report
   - Verify stat or cut it entirely

4. **Nature Paper Full Read**
   - Download full paper
   - Extract actual mechanisms
   - Verify if trust is mentioned

### HIGH PRIORITY (Needed for Actionable Frameworks):

5. **TCMM Full Paper (arXiv 2503.15511)**
   - Is it individual or organizational?
   - Can we create user-facing checklist?

6. **Effective Bias Mitigation Beyond Forewarning**
   - What works better than 6.9%?
   - Validated interventions from 2024-2025

7. **Memory Poisoning Defenses**
   - Princeton research details
   - Palo Alto Unit 42 recommendations
   - Individual-actionable strategies

8. **Contextual Information Specifics (arXiv 2401.04729)**
   - What contextual info exactly?
   - Templatable guidance?

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Positioning & Coverage):

## LOCAL RESEARCH CONCLUSION

### What We KNOW with Confidence:
1. ✅ Three mechanisms have 2024-2025 research backing
2. ✅ All critical stats verified EXCEPT "10% agent identity"
3. ✅ TCMM framework exists (arXiv 2503.15511)
4. ✅ Forewarning is ineffective (6.9% reduction)
5. ✅ Nature bias paper exists with strong findings
6. ✅ 42% organizational conflict documented

### What We DON'T KNOW (Critical Gaps):
1. ❌ Is "trust asymmetry" recognized cognitive science framing?
2. ❌ Current date and publication timeline clarity
3. ❌ Full Nature paper mechanisms - is trust explicit?
4. ❌ TCMM applicability to individuals
5. ❌ Effective bias mitigation strategies
6. ❌ Memory poisoning individual defenses
7. ❌ Specific contextual information that improves delegation
8. ❌ Coverage saturation for each mechanism

### Risk Assessment:

**HIGH RISK:**
- Trust asymmetry may be FORCED synthesis (exactly what roasting warned against)
- Could repeat Round 2 mistakes: forcing cognitive science onto unrelated problems

**MEDIUM RISK:**
- Nature paper may be well-covered (9 months if Sept 2025, 1 month if Jan 2025)
- Mitigation frameworks may not exist (stuck with awareness-only content)

**CRITICAL DECISION POINT:**
**WEB RESEARCH WILL DETERMINE:**
- ✅ If trust asymmetry is validated → Proceed with refinements
- ⚠️ If trust is weak connector → Separate into 3 posts or find better unifier
- ❌ If trust is forced → Abandon hybrid approach, pick best single mechanism
