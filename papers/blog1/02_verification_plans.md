## THEME 2: Trust Asymmetry Mechanism Validation

### Objective
Verify that trust asymmetry is causally explanatory (not forced connector)

### Sub-Themes

#### 2.1 Trust Asymmetry in Cognitive Science Literature

**Research Question:** Is "trust asymmetry" (questioning human memory but not AI memory) a recognized phenomenon in cognitive science?

**Local Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Search papers/prompting/research_group1_cognitive_parallels/ for "trust"
  - COMPREHENSIVE_RESEARCH_REPORT.md
  - component_3_fundamental_differences_limitations.md
  - Look for trust calibration research

- [ ] Check 2025 research for trust-related findings
  - component_3_cognitive_science_ai_intersection.md
  - Theory of Mind activation research (might relate to trust)

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Academic search: "trust asymmetry AI" "trust calibration AI vs human"
- [ ] Memory research: "human memory reliability AI trust"
- [ ] Cognitive science: "automated systems trust" "algorithm aversion vs appreciation"
- [ ] TCMM verification: "Trust Calibration Maturity Model"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Strong: Trust asymmetry documented in cognitive science literature
- ⚠️ Moderate: Related concepts (algorithm appreciation) but not exact framing
- ❌ Weak: No cognitive science backing, purely our interpretation

---

#### 2.2 Bias Inheritance and Trust Link

**Research Question:** Does Nature bias amplification research explicitly link to trust mechanisms?

**Local Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Re-read component_3_cognitive_science_ai_intersection.md bias section
  - Lines 189-198 on bias amplification
  - Check for trust mentions
  - Note actual mechanisms described (anchoring, confirmation, ToM)

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Find full Nature paper: Glickman & Sharot 2024
- [ ] Read mechanism explanation: Is trust mentioned?
- [ ] Related research: "AI bias inheritance trust" "anchoring AI recommendations"
- [ ] Theory of Mind connection: Does anthropomorphization increase trust?

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Strong: Trust is explicit mechanism in Nature paper
- ⚠️ Moderate: Trust is reasonable interpretation of findings
- ❌ Weak: Trust is forced; actual mechanisms are anchoring + confirmation only

---

#### 2.3 Metacognitive Failure and Trust Link

**Research Question:** Is metacognitive failure about trust or about capability assessment?

**Local Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Re-read delegation research section
  - Component 3.4: Delegation Failures (line 232-237)
  - Root cause: "Humans lack metaknowledge - cannot assess own capabilities correctly"
  - Is this about trust or self-assessment accuracy?

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Find original delegation research: Information Systems Research findings
- [ ] Read: Is failure about trusting AI too much or about poor self-assessment?
- [ ] Related: "Dunning-Kruger effect AI delegation" "metacognitive calibration"

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Strong: Trust in AI over self is explicit mechanism
- ⚠️ Moderate: Trust is one component among several
- ❌ Weak: Primarily about poor self-assessment, not trust asymmetry

---

#### 2.4 Unified Trust Framework Validity

**Research Question:** Can these three mechanisms be coherently unified under trust asymmetry?

**Synthesis Task:** After completing 2.1-2.3, assess:

**Decision Matrix:**
```
IF all three mechanisms explicitly link to trust → ✅ Trust asymmetry is valid unifier
IF 2/3 link strongly to trust → ⚠️ Use trust as primary angle, acknowledge other mechanisms
IF only 1/3 links to trust → ❌ Trust asymmetry is forced; find better connector or separate articles
```

**Alternative Connectors to Consider:**
- Cognitive bias amplification (broader)
- Automation reliance
- Metacognitive challenges in AI age
- AI-human collaboration failures

  - **Details:** "Interpretability + uncertainty awareness enable rapid calibration"
  - **Status:** Mentioned but not detailed

- [ ] Search for TCMM details in component files
  - component_3_cognitive_science_ai_intersection.md
  - Look for source citation, framework details

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Academic search: "Trust Calibration Maturity Model TCMM"
- [ ] arXiv search: "arXiv 2503.15511" (mentioned in comprehensive report line 451)

- [ ] Validation: Has TCMM been empirically tested?

**Deliverable:**
- [ ] If TCMM exists and is validated → Adapt to personal trust calibration checklist

  - Pattern tracking: Document decisions with/without AI
  - Comparative analysis: Your judgments vs AI suggestions over time

- [ ] Mitigation Strategies (evidence-based only)
  - Only include interventions with validation
  - Specify effect sizes from research
  - Honest about limitations (if max reduction is 20%, say so)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Multiple validated strategies with >20% bias reduction
- ⚠️ Some strategies exist but modest effects (10-20% reduction)
- ❌ No validated strategies beyond forewarning (stick to detection only)

**Local Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Re-read memory poisoning section

  - Red flags for behavioral drift
  - Detection strategies

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Princeton research: Agent memory poisoning (verify local mention)
- [ ] Palo Alto Unit 42: 9 attack scenarios - what are individual defenses?
- [ ] Microsoft CVE-2025-32711: Recommended user actions
- [ ] Agent security best practices: ChatGPT memory, Claude Projects, Copilot

**Framework Development:**
Create tiered protocol:
- **Tier 1: What individuals can do NOW**
  - Baseline behavior documentation (actionable: how?)
  - Memory reset decision criteria (actionable: when?)
  - Red flags for behavioral drift (actionable: what to watch?)

- **Tier 2: What developers can implement**
  - (Note: Developers can implement but individuals can REQUEST)

- **Tier 3: What requires platform support**
  - (Note: Include to set realistic expectations)

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ 5+ individual-actionable strategies with clear implementation steps
- ⚠️ 2-3 strategies but most require platform support
- ❌ No individual-actionable defenses; all platform-dependent

## THEME 4: Audience & Positioning Research

### Objective
Determine if multi-mechanism approach works or creates dilution

### Sub-Themes

#### 4.1 Multi-Mechanism Blog Performance

**Research Question:** Do blogs covering 3 separate mechanisms perform better or worse than focused deep-dives?

**Web Research Tasks:**
- [ ] Blog analytics research: "multi-topic vs focused blog posts performance"
- [ ] Content marketing: "list posts vs narrative deep dives"
- [ ] Medium/Substack data: Do "3 ways" posts outperform single-topic posts?
- [ ] Time on page: Do readers engage with all sections or skim?

**Decision Framework:**
```
IF multi-topic posts show equal/better engagement → ✅ Proceed with 3 mechanisms
IF focused posts significantly outperform → ⚠️ Consider separating into 3 posts
IF "3 ways" format is overused/cliché → ❌ Find alternative structure
```
