the main goal: create new age great practical prompting framework based on results of latest researches of AI and human behaviour their commons and differences. 
the idea: latest researches show great common patterns of AI and human thinking, that make possible to use some technics and approaches working for humans in prompting with great predictable results. also due to better understanding of ai internal processes we know better differences ai processes from humans, and can use this knowledge to use different approaches for ai instead of human like. Currently we have huge experience in prompting and can summarize and verify it from ai and human behaviour and inside processes knowledge and create well working, effective and predictable prompting approach. this approach will include theoretical general princilpes, applied approaches and practical techniques for different cases. it should include all sides of iteractions with LLMs (AI and user one time question, tasks for agents, depp researches and etc, chat system prompts and definitions for chats, agents, tools, short and long context queries, iteraction with (non)thinking models and etc and etc)

audience: theoretical part - for AI, IT and human related scientiests, applied approaches - for AI and AI engeneers and architects, practical techniques for applied approaches audience and for wide audience. 

deliverables: 
1. serie of science papers on Arxive includig thoretical researches and practical theory and methods approvments
2. serie of blog posts for ai interesting audience supported by linkedin, reddit, x posts
3. dry useful practical framework
