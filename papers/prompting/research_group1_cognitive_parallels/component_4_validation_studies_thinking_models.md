## Executive Summary

This component investigates recent validation studies (2023-2025) and the emergence of "thinking models" that represent a paradigm shift in LLM architecture. Key finding: **Reasoning models that incorporate extended thinking time through reinforcement learning show dramatically improved performance on complex cognitive tasks (math, coding, science) but introduce new cognitive patterns—including emergent self-reflection and verification—that change how cognitive parallels apply to prompting.**

---

## 1. The Emergence of Reasoning Models

### 1.1 Core Architectural Innovation

**Fundamental Shift:**
OpenAI o1 is a new large language model trained with **reinforcement learning to perform complex reasoning**. o1 thinks before it answers—it can produce a **long internal chain of thought** before responding to the user.

**Training Approach:**
OpenAI's large-scale reinforcement learning algorithm teaches the model **how to think productively using its chain of thought**. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes.

**Two-Dimensional Scaling:**
The performance of o1 consistently improves with:
1. **More reinforcement learning (train-time compute)**
2. **More time spent thinking (test-time compute)**

This ability to think before responding represents a **new, additional paradigm**, which is improving model outputs by spending more computing power when generating the answer.

### 1.2 Cognitive Architecture Components

**Reasoning Tokens:**
At the core of this transformation lies the architecture of the o1 model, which introduces **reasoning tokens** and leverages reinforcement learning to solve tasks that were previously too difficult for AI systems.

**Hidden Chain-of-Thought:**
OpenAI's o1 and o3 models are built on a GPT-4-level transformer architecture but with the ability to **generate lengthy hidden reasoning sequences** before final answers, adding a "test-time compute" dimension where the model effectively thinks longer by generating internal tokens that users don't see.

**Private Chain-of-Thought:**
The o3 models take it further by thinking through problems and planning their responses ahead of time using a **"private chain-of-thought" technique**.

## 4. Test-Time Compute Scaling

### 4.1 The Scaling Paradigm Shift

**Key Research Finding (Google DeepMind, August 2024):**
Holding total computation constant, **moving computation from training time to test time can lead to a smaller model outperforming a 14x larger model**.

**Two-Phase Scaling:**
The shift to slow thinking introduced with OpenAI's o1 model demonstrated how remarkable a model's reasoning capabilities can be through Chain-of-Thought reasoning. This represents a fundamental change from:
- **Pre-reasoning era:** Scale through more parameters and training data
- **Reasoning era:** Scale through extended thinking time at inference

**Sources:**

---

### 4.2 Performance-Complexity Tradeoffs

**Three Performance Regimes:**
Research comparing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with standard LLM counterparts under equivalent inference compute identified three performance regimes:

1. **Low-complexity tasks:** Standard models **surprisingly outperform** LRMs
2. **Medium-complexity tasks:** Additional thinking in LRMs demonstrates **clear advantage**
3. **High-complexity tasks:** Both face challenges

**Scaling Limitations:**
Frontier LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities and exhibit a **counter-intuitive scaling limit**: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget.

**Classification Task Example:**
On classification tasks:
- GPT-4o: **74/100** correct
- O1: **73/100** correct
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: **76/100** correct

This reinforces the idea that smarter, more cost-effective models without a "reasoning module" can perform just as well as o1 on simpler tasks.

## 5. Advanced Reasoning Frameworks (2024)

### 5.1 Forest-of-Thought (FoT)

**Novel Framework:**
Researchers proposed **Forest-of-Thought (FoT)**, a reasoning framework that integrates multiple reasoning trees to leverage collective decision-making, employing **sparse activation strategies** to select the most relevant reasoning paths.

**Source:**
- [Forest-of-Thought: Scaling Test-Time Compute, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09078)

---

### 5.2 Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

**Cognitive Simulation:**
Tree of thoughts (ToT) is a framework designed to **enhance the reasoning capabilities** of LLMs, simulating human cognitive strategies by enabling LLMs to explore multiple potential solutions in a structured manner where each step can branch into multiple paths.

## 6. Hallucination and Factuality in Reasoning Models

### 6.1 Mixed Results on Knowledge-Intensive Tasks

**Critical Finding:**
Recently evolved **large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in solving complex tasks** with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability, but whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help **reduce hallucination in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated**.

**Contradictory Performance:**
- DeepSeek-R1 reports **increased performance** on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark
- OpenAI-o3 observes **even severer hallucination**

**Sources:**
- [Are Reasoning Models More Prone to Hallucination? ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23646)
- [Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks Yet, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.06861)

---

### 6.2 Concerning Hallucination Rates (2025 Data)

**PersonQA Benchmark Results:**
On OpenAI's PersonQA benchmark, which tests knowledge about public figures:
- o1: **16%** hallucination rate
- o3: **33%** hallucination rate (worse than o1)
- o4-mini: **48%** hallucination rate (even worse)

**Best-in-Class Performance:**
Google's Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 achieved an industry-leading hallucination rate of just **0.7%** in 2025, showing that significant improvements are possible even with reasoning techniques and extensive knowledge verification.

---

### 6.3 Mechanisms of Hallucination in Reasoning Models

**Two Critical Cognitive Behaviors:**
Research identifies two critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM:

1. **Flaw Repetition:** The surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the same underlying flawed logic
2. **Think-Answer Mismatch:** The final answer fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process

**Training Impact:**
- LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with **cold start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate their hallucination**
- Both **distillation alone and RL training without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations**

**Abstention vs. Recall:**
**Reduced hallucinations often result from the model choosing to abstain** after thinking more, rather than from improved factual recall. For some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations.

**GPT-5 Improvements:**
GPT‑5 has significantly fewer hallucinations especially when reasoning⁠, but they **still occur**.

## 7. Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities (o3)

### 7.1 Tool Integration

**Agentic Tool Use:**
For the first time, OpenAI's reasoning models can **agentically use and combine every tool within ChatGPT**—including:
- Searching the web
- Analyzing files with Python
- Reasoning about visual inputs
- Generating images

They are trained to reason about **when and how to use tools**.

---

### 7.2 Visual-Textual Integration

**Multimodal Chain-of-Thought:**
o3 can **reason with images directly in its chain of thought**, blending visual and textual reasoning while solving problems.

**Simulated Reasoning with Multimodality:**
Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on simple pattern recognition, the o3 model incorporates **"simulated reasoning" (SR)**, which allows the model to pause and reflect on its own internal thought processes before responding, mimicking human-like reasoning, now **extended to visual inputs**.

## 8. Prompting Strategy Implications

### 8.1 Fundamental Differences from Standard LLMs

**Standard LLMs:**
- Generate text using **autoregression**, predicting the most likely next word based on previous words
- Are fine-tuned to follow user intent
- May fail to provide correct answers for complex tasks if they don't have time to calculate through multiple tokens

**Reasoning Models:**
- Used at two different levels: 1) **processing the input and generating via multiple intermediate steps** and 2) providing some sort of reasoning as part of the response to the user
- With time or guidance to reason things out, the model may still be able to answer reliably

- [The Ultimate Guide to LLM Reasoning, Kili Technology](https://kili-technology.com/large-language-models-llms/llm-reasoning-guide)

---

### 8.2 When to Use Reasoning vs. Standard Models

**Reasoning Model Optimal Use Cases:**
- Complex mathematical problems
- Multi-step logical reasoning
- Scientific problem-solving requiring deep analysis
- Competitive programming challenges
- Tasks requiring self-verification
- Problems benefiting from extended thinking time

**Standard Model Advantages:**
- Simple classification tasks
- Fast response requirements
- Low-complexity queries
- Cost-sensitive applications
- Tasks where pattern matching suffices

**Critical Insight:**
The development of reasoning models is **a specialization that refines LLMs to excel at complex tasks** that are best solved with intermediate steps, such as puzzles, advanced math, and coding challenges. This specialization **does not replace other LLM applications** because transforming an LLM into a reasoning model also introduces certain drawbacks.

---

### 8.3 Chain-of-Thought Prompting Evolution

**Classic CoT Prompting:**
A method proposed by the University of Tokyo and Google Research consisted of simply adding **"Let's think step by step"** at the end of prompts, prompting the model to reason out loud and go through all the required steps.

Chain-of-thought prompting guides LLMs to outline their reasoning step-by-step, making the process **more transparent**, and is a widely used advanced prompting method that guides LLMs to produce detailed, step-by-step reasoning in their responses.

**For Reasoning Models:**
Most LLMs branded as reasoning models today include a "thought" or "thinking" process as part of their response, with some like OpenAI's o1 **running multiple iterations with intermediate steps that are not shown to the user**.

**Key Difference:**
With reasoning models, **explicit CoT prompting becomes less critical** because the model is already trained to think step-by-step internally. However, CoT prompting remains valuable for:
- Guiding the reasoning direction
- Making thought processes transparent
- Debugging reasoning errors

## 9. Alignment and Safety Implications

### 9.1 Interpretability Benefits

**Observable Reasoning:**
Chain of thought reasoning provides **new opportunities for alignment and safety**, enabling observation of the model thinking in a **legible way**.

**Robust Safety Reasoning:**
The model reasoning about safety rules is **more robust to out-of-distribution scenarios**.

**Sources:**
- [Learning to reason with LLMs, OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)

---

### 9.2 Strong vs. Weak Alignment

**Cognitive Alignment:**
Research proposes to distinguish **strong and weak value alignment**, where **strong alignment requires cognitive abilities such as understanding and reasoning**.

**Implication:** Reasoning models may enable more sophisticated alignment techniques that leverage their enhanced cognitive capabilities.

## 10. Future Directions and Open Questions

### 10.1 Limitations for Further Research

**Knowledge-Intensive Tasks:**
Whether reasoning models can effectively handle knowledge-intensive, fact-seeking tasks remains unclear, with mixed evidence on hallucination reduction.

**Computational Tradeoffs:**
For particularly challenging problems, even when small models perform numerous reasoning steps, their improvements remain limited, and **only expanding the model's parameters and investing more in train-time compute** can lead to substantial performance gains.

**Behavior vs. Performance:**
There's a **critical distinction between reasoning behavior and reasoning performance**—while performance metrics might show high accuracy on specific tasks, examining the underlying reasoning behavior often reveals that LLMs are not employing systematic, logical reasoning.

### 10.2 Cognitive Science Implications

**Emergent Metacognition:**
The emergence of self-verification, reflection, and "aha moments" in reasoning models suggests they may be developing **primitive forms of metacognition** not present in standard LLMs.

**Human-Like Reasoning Patterns:**
Similar to how a human may think for a long time before responding to a difficult question, reasoning models use extended thinking time. This represents a **closer functional parallel to human cognitive processes** than standard next-token prediction.

**Reinforcement Learning as Cognitive Development:**
The use of RL to train reasoning capabilities mirrors aspects of human learning through trial, error, and feedback—potentially creating **more human-like cognitive development patterns**.

**Open Questions:**
- Do reasoning models truly understand, or just simulate understanding more convincingly?
- How do emergent metacognitive behaviors change the validity of cognitive parallels?
- Can reasoning models develop genuine common sense, or only excel at formal reasoning?
