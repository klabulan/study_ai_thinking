# Research Component 3: Fundamental Differences and Limitations of Cognitive Analogies

**Research Period:** January 2025
**Focus Areas:** Where AI and human cognition diverge, limitations of cognitive analogies, prompting implications
**Sources Collected:** 18+

---

## Executive Summary

This component investigates fundamental differences between human and AI cognition that invalidate direct cognitive analogies and require different prompting approaches. Key finding: **While functional similarities exist, LLMs lack embodied grounding, genuine conceptual understanding, flexible common sense reasoning, and reliable self-monitoring—requiring prompting strategies that compensate for these architectural differences rather than assuming human-like cognition.**

---

## 1. Embodied Cognition and Symbol Grounding

### 1.1 The Symbol Grounding Problem

**Core Issue:** Even multimodal LLMs still lack any kind of organic symbol grounding. Research argues that LLMs alone tell us very little about human language and cognition in terms of acquisition and evolution. Any similarities between human language and the output of LLMs are **purely functional**.

**Human Grounding:**
In humans, it has been hypothesized that linguistic meaning is grounded through "embodied simulation"—the activation of sensorimotor and affective representations reflecting described experiences.

**LLM Limitation:**
Connecting LLMs' representations to the external world with multimodal approaches or with robots' bodies is **not enough to let them understand the meaning** of the language they are manipulating.

### 1.2 Sensorimotor vs. Non-Sensorimotor Concepts (2024 Nature Study)

**Key Finding:** Large language models align with human representations in **non-sensorimotor domains** but **diverge in sensorimotor ones**, with additional visual training associated with enhanced alignment.

**Implications:**
LLMs' limitation in capturing human-like sensorimotor conceptual understanding via textual data and incomplete sensorimotor input underscores the **importance of grounding for human conceptual knowledge**. This delineates the boundary of language-domain training.

**Physical and Social Reasoning:**
LLMs struggle with tasks demanding skills such as **physical and social reasoning**, which are essential in Human-Robot Interaction.

### 1.3 Prompting Implications for Embodied Cognition Gaps

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Physical intuition (gravity, momentum, friction)
- Spatial reasoning from experience
- Sensorimotor associations (texture, weight, temperature)
- Body-based metaphors (heavy burden, warm welcome)

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Provide explicit physical descriptions rather than relying on embodied understanding
- Include relevant sensorimotor details when they matter for the task
- Use verbal descriptions of spatial relationships rather than assuming intuitive grasp
- Avoid relying on physical metaphors without explanation

## 2. Common Sense Reasoning Limitations

### 2.1 Performance vs. Generalization

**Paradox:** Large language models like BERT and GPT-3 are getting better at "commonsense reasoning" and some even demonstrate human-like performance on benchmarks, but they're **not yet ready to replace humans** in certain language-based tasks.

**Benchmark Performance (2024):**
Llama 3 outperformed humans on all datasets with an average **21% higher accuracy** on common sense reasoning benchmarks.

**Critical Limitation:**
When tested on **unfamiliar benchmarks**, models like RoBERTa showed significant performance decreases, demonstrating that they were **not able to generalize well about common sense**—an essential capability for AI to navigate the complex real world.

- [Benchmarks for Automated Commonsense Reasoning: A Survey, ACM](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3615355)

---

### 2.2 Memorization vs. Genuine Reasoning

**Pattern Recognition:**
Models showed **high performance limited to common task variants** and suffered from consistent and severe performance drop in unfamiliar counterfactual scenarios.

**Human Advantage:**
Compared with humans, existing AI lacks several features of human commonsense reasoning; most notably, humans have **powerful mechanisms for reasoning about "naïve physics"** such as space, time, and physical interactions.

**Similarity to Humans:**
Like humans, LLMs answer more accurately when semantic content supports logical inferences, with parallels reflected in accuracy patterns and features like the relationship between model confidence and human response times.

**Critical Difference:**
AI and human cognition **don't share significant similarities as forms of computation**, with the analogy quickly breaking down when it comes to understanding novelty, new knowledge, and decision making under uncertainty.

### 2.3 Prompting Implications for Common Sense Gaps

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Intuitive physics (what happens when objects collide, fall, or interact)
- Everyday causal relationships (wet floor → slippery)
- Social norms and expectations
- Practical constraints (can't fit elephant in backpack)

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Explicitly state relevant physical laws or constraints
- Provide causal chains rather than expecting inference
- Include social context when relevant
- Spell out practical limitations rather than assuming common sense recognition

---

## 3. Temporal Reasoning and Sequential Understanding

### 3.1 Core Limitations Identified (2024)

**Challenge:** Temporal reasoning presents a **significant challenge** for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic.

**Key Issues:**
- Recent investigations reveal a notable deficiency in LLMs' ability to reason effectively over tabular data, particularly when temporal relationships are involved
- A significant gap remains when considering complex reasoning tasks such as **event forecasting**, which requires multi-step temporal reasoning on events and prediction on the future timestamp
- Another notable limitation is their **incapability to illustrate their reasoning process** for explaining their prediction, hindering explainability

**Sources:**

- [Test of Time: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Temporal Reasoning, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2406.09170v1)

---

### 3.2 Temporal Blind Spots

**Pre-training Limitations:**
The pre-training data utilized in LLMs is often confined to a specific corpus, resulting in inherent **freshness and temporal scope limitations**, raising concerns regarding the effectiveness of LLMs for tasks involving temporal intents.

**Performance Patterns:**
Low performance was observed on detailed questions about the past and, surprisingly, for **rather new information**.

**Modeling Challenges:**
LLM-based methods often rely heavily on historical facts without explicitly modeling their temporal validity, and a **critical challenge lies in accurately modeling temporal dependencies** while accounting for the dynamic nature of temporal validity.

**Sources:**

- [Leveraging temporal validity of rules via LLMs, ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705125011396)

---

### 3.3 Prompting Implications for Temporal Reasoning

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Implicit temporal ordering
- Knowledge of recent events post-training cutoff
- Understanding of temporal validity (when facts became true/false)
- Ability to track complex time-dependent state changes

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Explicitly provide temporal ordering and sequencing
- Include timestamps and temporal markers
- State when facts became valid or changed
- Break complex temporal reasoning into explicit step-by-step sequences
- Provide current date/time context when relevant

---

## 4. Social Context and Pragmatic Understanding

### 4.1 Pragmatic Competence Limitations

**Core Finding:** Despite advances with transformer-based models like BERT and GPT, their performance in understanding **pragmatics remains limited**. Evaluating LLMs' ability to handle pragmatic phenomena such as implicatures and references remains challenging.

**Social Context Challenges:**
Models tend to struggle with phenomena relying on **social expectation violations**. Current evaluation metrics, largely based on traditional NLP tasks, fail to capture the nuances of how well LLMs handle context and social norms.

**Sources:**
- [Pragmatics in the Era of LLMs: A Survey, ArXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12378)
- [Why pragmatic competence remains elusive for LLMs, Medium](https://medium.com/@riazleghari/why-pragmatic-competence-remains-elusive-for-large-language-models-llms-5ec02cc55fd4)

---

### 4.2 Specific Pragmatic Failures

**Implicature Interpretation:**
The model had difficulties sometimes in interpreting **impoliteness generated through implicature**. Most LLMs performed **at or below chance levels** in detecting manner implicatures.

**Sophisticated Cues:**
While LLMs may be adept at handling surface-level linguistic patterns, their capacity to interpret more **sophisticated, context-dependent pragmatic cues remains limited**.

**Developmental Comparison:**
Even within the first two years of life, before they begin producing complex grammatically correct utterances, **children display functional linguistic capacities that LLMs lack**. Pragmatic knowledge and gesture play an important role in how children incrementally build their grammars.

**Contextual Integration:**
Human speakers can quickly integrate semantically-underspecified linguistic signals with a wide range of non-linguistic information, while **standard NLP models have no or limited access to such extra information**.

---

### 4.3 Prompting Implications for Pragmatic Understanding

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Reading between the lines (implicit meanings)
- Understanding social cues and politeness levels
- Detecting sarcasm, irony, or indirect speech acts
- Grasping cultural communication norms

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Make implicit meanings explicit
- Clarify intended tone and communication style
- Explain social expectations and norms when relevant
- Provide cultural context for communication conventions
- Use direct language rather than relying on implicature

---

## 5. Numerical and Mathematical Reasoning

### 5.1 Pattern Matching vs. Genuine Mathematical Understanding

**Core Limitation:** Research hypothesizes that current LLMs **cannot perform genuine logical reasoning**; instead, they replicate reasoning steps from their training data. Rather than employing true logical reasoning, LLMs often engage in **sophisticated pattern matching**, which can be highly effective when dealing with familiar patterns but may fail in novel situations.

---

### 5.2 Specific Mathematical Failures (2024 Research)

**Irrelevant Information:**
When presented with problems containing **extraneous numerical information**, models consistently incorporated these irrelevant numbers into their calculations, revealing a fundamental weakness in distinguishing crucial information from distractors.

**Critical Finding:** Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question causes **significant performance drops (up to 65%)** across all state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to the reasoning chain needed for the final answer.

**Sensitivity to Variations:**
The performance of all models declines when only the numerical values in the question are altered, and their performance significantly deteriorates as the number of clauses in a question increases.

**Proof vs. Numerical Answers:**
The poor performance of LLMs on problems that require **rigorous proof generation**, as opposed to numerical answers, suggests a potential "reasoning illusion".

**Advanced Mathematics:**
Even a leading model like Gemini-2.5-PRO achieved an average score of only **25%** on advanced mathematical olympiad (AMO) problems, with other prominent models scoring below 5%.

### 5.3 Prompting Implications for Mathematical Reasoning

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Ability to filter relevant from irrelevant numerical information
- Robust performance when numerical values change
- Understanding of mathematical proof vs. calculation
- Deep conceptual mathematical understanding

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Explicitly identify which numbers are relevant
- Structure problems with clear mathematical relationships
- Break complex calculations into explicit steps
- Verify results through multiple approaches
- For proofs, provide explicit logical structure
- Use verification prompts to check mathematical consistency

## 6. World Knowledge and Recency Bias

### 6.1 Knowledge Cutoff and Temporal Limitations

**Fundamental Constraint:**
LLMs like GPT-4 rely on pre-trained knowledge sets with a "knowledge cutoff," meaning they lack access to **real-time data or updates** unless fine-tuned or connected to external sources.

**Example:** BERT is pretrained on a Wikipedia dump that predates COVID-19, the James Webb telescope launch, and the 2020 Summer Olympics, illustrating fundamental temporal limitations.

- [Bias in Large Language Models: Origin, Evaluation, and Mitigation, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.10915v1)

---

### 6.2 Recency and Generalization Bias

**Recency Bias:**
Recent research shows that recency bias in LLMs is **similar to humans**—models remember the last thing they encountered better than other information, with studies finding that even AI models designed to remember large amounts of information struggle with this.

**Generalization Bias (2024 Research):**
Analysis of nearly 5000 LLM-generated science summaries revealed **most models produced broader generalizations than original texts**, with newer models exhibiting significantly greater inaccuracies, indicating a persistent generalization bias.

**Persistent Social Biases:**
Large language models can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, showing **pervasive stereotype biases** across race, gender, religion, and health categories in 21 stereotypes, even in value-aligned models.

**Knowledge Enhancement Paradox:**
Knowledge-enhanced approaches are often assumed to enhance trustworthiness and objectivity, but empirical evaluations demonstrate that knowledge enhancement **may not reduce bias**—stereotypical associations and performance-related gender gaps were preserved.

### 6.3 Prompting Implications for World Knowledge Limitations

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Knowledge of events after training cutoff
- Unbiased factual knowledge
- Accurate generalization from specific to general
- Equal knowledge depth across all domains

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Provide current information when post-cutoff knowledge is required
- Use retrieval-augmented generation for time-sensitive information
- Explicitly state the time context of questions
- Cross-reference critical factual claims
- Be aware of potential biases in training data
- Request multiple perspectives on controversial topics

## 7. Multimodal Perception and Visual Reasoning

### 7.1 Visual-Linguistic Integration Limitations (2024)

**Complex Reasoning:**
Traditional Vision-Language models (VLMs) perform well in visual perception tasks while **struggling with complex reasoning scenarios**.

**Fundamental Perception:**
Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face **challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks** where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection, yet **MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over**.

**Sources:**
- [Visual cognition in multimodal large language models, Nature Machine Intelligence](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00963-y)
- [Exploring Perceptual Limitation of Multimodal LLMs, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07384)

---

### 7.2 Specific Perceptual Failures

**Four Independent Factors** contribute to perceptual limitations:
1. **Object quality**
2. **Size** (smaller objects harder to detect)
3. **Distractors** (presence of visual noise)
4. **Location** (position in image affects accuracy)

**Performance Gap:**
While some models exhibit proficient visual data processing capabilities, they **fall short of human performance** in these cognitive domains.

**Complex Interactions:**
Modern vision-based language models face challenges with **complex physical interactions, causal reasoning and intuitive psychology**.

**Generalization Issues:**
Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and **outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive** and memory-inefficient.

- [A survey on multimodal large language models, PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11645129/)

---

### 7.3 Prompting Implications for Multimodal Limitations

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Fine-grained visual perception (small objects, details)
- Spatial reasoning in complex scenes
- 3D structure understanding from 2D images
- Robust performance with visual distractors

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Describe visual content explicitly when critical
- Highlight important objects and their locations
- Provide spatial relationships verbally
- Specify object sizes and positions
- Remove or note visual distractors
- Use text descriptions as backup for critical visual information

---

## 8. Counterfactual and Hypothetical Reasoning

### 8.1 Knowledge Conflict Issues

**Core Problem:** Despite powerful fact memorization and retrieval, current LLMs **lack mechanisms to dynamically modify their internal knowledge graph** in response to new or conflicting information.

**Performance Pattern:**
While LLMs correctly reason through standard knowledge-consistent tasks, they often **incorrectly assess counterfactual (hypothetical knowledge-conflicting) tasks** despite having the same logical structure.

**Implication:** When faced with premises that contradict their parametric knowledge, LLMs often **fail to maintain consistent reasoning performance**.

**Sources:**
- [LLMs Struggle to Perform Counterfactual Reasoning with Parametric Knowledge, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.15732v1)
- [On the Eligibility of LLMs for Counterfactual Reasoning, ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.11839v1)

---

### 8.2 Systematic Performance Degradation (2024)

**Overestimation:**
LLMs can recite answers but struggle to reason in abstract task-solving, with their reasoning abilities often **overestimated**.

**Quantified Impact:**
A systematic evaluation of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs on 6 different datasets demonstrated a consistent pattern of **performance degradation (-27% on average)** when reasoning through counterfactual statements.

**Transferability Issues:**
Across a suite of 11 tasks, performance substantially and consistently degrades in counterfactual variants compared to default conditions, suggesting that while LMs may possess abstract task-solving skills to an extent, they often **rely on narrow, non-transferable procedures**.

- [Reasoning or Reciting? ACL 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.102/)

---

### 8.3 Prompting Implications for Counterfactual Reasoning

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Ability to override parametric knowledge with hypothetical premises
- Consistent logical reasoning in knowledge-conflicting scenarios
- Flexible adaptation to counterfactual worlds
- Transfer of reasoning patterns to novel contexts

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Explicitly emphasize that scenario is hypothetical/counterfactual
- Repeat counterfactual premises multiple times
- Ask model to acknowledge the hypothetical nature before reasoning
- Structure as "In this scenario where X is true (different from real world), ..."
- Verify consistency with hypothetical premises throughout reasoning
- Use step-by-step reasoning to maintain counterfactual coherence

---

## 9. Metacognitive Awareness and Self-Monitoring

### 9.1 Limited Metacognitive Capabilities

**Metacognitive Space Constraints:**
Research reveals a "metacognitive space" with dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting **LLMs can monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms**.

**Critical Finding:** Understanding the limits of their metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal activations, is **critical given society's increased reliance** on these models.

**Sources:**
- [Language Models Are Capable of Metacognitive Monitoring, ArXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13763)
- [Large LLMs lack essential metacognition for reliable medical reasoning, Nature Communications 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55628-6)

---

### 9.2 Specific Metacognitive Failures

**Medical Decision-Making Study (Nature 2025):**
LLMs show:
- Significant gaps in **recognizing knowledge limitations**
- Difficulties in **modulating their confidence**
- Challenges in **identifying when a problem cannot be answered** due to insufficient information

**General Limitations:**
Current LLMs' metacognitive abilities are **limited and uneven**. A model might articulate a reasoning chain, but there's no guarantee it truly "monitors" all relevant internal steps—often it can still **fall prey to reasoning errors or hallucinations while believing itself to be correct**.

**Safety Implications:**
Metacognitive abilities enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might **obscure their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms** designed to detect harmful behaviors.

- [The Metacognitive Demands and Opportunities of Generative AI, CHI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642902)

---

### 9.3 Prompting Implications for Metacognitive Limitations

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Accurate self-assessment of knowledge gaps
- Reliable confidence calibration
- Recognition of when questions are unanswerable
- Awareness of reasoning errors in real-time

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Explicitly request uncertainty acknowledgment
- Ask for confidence levels with justification
- Request identification of knowledge limitations
- Use verification prompts to catch errors
- Prompt for alternative interpretations
- Ask model to explain its reasoning process step-by-step
- Request self-critique before finalizing answers

---

## 10. Pattern Matching vs. Conceptual Understanding

### 10.1 The Core Limitation (2024 Consensus)

**Fundamental Operation:**
Research highlights a core problem: today's models mostly rely on **statistical pattern matching, not genuine reasoning**.

**Medical Reasoning Evidence:**
A study in JAMA Network Open raises fresh doubts about whether LLMs can actually reason through medical cases or if they're just matching patterns they've seen before. Standard LLMs like:
- Claude 3.5: **-26.5 percentage points** drop
- Gemini 2.0: **-33.8 percentage points** drop
- GPT-4o: **-36.8 percentage points** drop
- LLaMA 3.3: **-38.2 percentage points** drop

All took major hits when answer options were changed.

### 10.2 How LLMs Actually Work vs. Human Understanding

**LLM Processing:**
LLMs are essentially very powerful **pattern recognition systems** that learn to predict the next word based on statistical relationships between words and concepts—capturing correlations, associations, and patterns in the data.

**Lack of Genuine Understanding:**
LLMs do not "understand" the content of their responses. They generate text based on statistical patterns, and while these patterns can often produce convincing results, they **lack the depth and flexibility of true logical reasoning**.

**Human vs. AI:**
Humans can understand concepts from the rules alone and can play a game of chess by reading the instruction manual without ever witnessing a single game. This is **distinctly different from pattern-matching AI**.

**The Illusion:**
When slight variations or irrelevant details are introduced into a question, the models frequently stumble, revealing that they are **not engaging in genuine reasoning**, but are instead reproducing familiar patterns.

### 10.3 Prompting Implications for Pattern Matching Limitations

**❌ Avoid Assuming:**
- Deep conceptual understanding beyond training patterns
- Ability to reason from first principles
- Genuine comprehension of abstract concepts
- Robust generalization to out-of-distribution examples

**✅ Compensatory Prompting Strategies:**
- Provide examples similar to desired output pattern
- Break novel problems into familiar pattern components
- Explicitly connect new problems to known patterns
- Use analogies to training-likely scenarios
- Verify understanding through paraphrasing and examples
- Test robustness with slight variations
- Provide explicit reasoning frameworks rather than expecting discovery

---

### Framework Design Principles Based on Limitations

**Principle 1: Explicit Over Implicit**
Since LLMs lack embodied grounding and common sense, **make implicit knowledge explicit** in prompts.

**Principle 2: Pattern Support**
Provide examples and structures that align with likely training patterns rather than expecting novel reasoning.

**Principle 3: Temporal Awareness**
Always provide temporal context and current information when relevant, don't assume knowledge of recent events.

**Principle 4: Verification Loops**
Build in self-checking mechanisms to compensate for limited metacognitive awareness.

**Principle 5: Constraint Specification**
Explicitly state physical, social, and logical constraints rather than assuming common sense recognition.

**Principle 6: Counterfactual Reinforcement**
When dealing with hypothetical scenarios, repeatedly emphasize the counterfactual nature and verify consistency.

**Principle 7: Mathematical Structuring**
For quantitative reasoning, explicitly identify relevant information and provide clear calculation frameworks.

**Principle 8: Social Context Provision**
Don't rely on pragmatic inference—make social expectations and communication norms explicit.
