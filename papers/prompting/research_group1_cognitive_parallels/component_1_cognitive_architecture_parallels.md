## 1. Attention Mechanisms: Validated Parallels

### 1.1 Selective Attention and Self-Attention

**Core Parallel:** Both human and transformer attention selectively focus on relevant information while suppressing irrelevant details.

**Human Attention (Cognitive Science):**
- Attention is a complex cognitive function where humans do not process whole information in its entirety at once, but instead selectively concentrate on a part of the information when and where it is needed
- Dynamically allocates neural resources based on task demands
- Essential for working memory management and information prioritization

**Transformer Self-Attention:**
- Adjusts weights of elements in input data, emphasizing critical features while de-emphasizing redundant ones
- Assigns different levels of importance to various elements in input data
- Enables models to focus on relevant context when processing each token

**Recent Research (2024-2025):**
A 2025 paper on Double-Attention (DA) method improves neural network's biomimetic performance by incorporating matrices generated from shifted images into the self-attention mechanism, directly modeling human attention processes [Double Attention: An Optimization Method for the Self-Attention Mechanism Based on Human Attention, PMC 2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11762873/).

### 1.2 Multi-Head Attention and Parallel Processing

**Core Parallel:** Both systems process multiple aspects of information simultaneously through distributed, parallel mechanisms.

**Human Cognitive Architecture:**
- Following connectionist cognitive theory, semantic information is encoded in parallel with activation of a frontal-temporal-parietal neural joint attention network
- The parallel distributed processing approach emphasizes that cognitive processes arise from interactions of neurons through synaptic connections
- Knowledge stored in connection strengths, acquired gradually through experience

**Multi-Head Attention in Transformers:**
- Runs attention mechanism several times in parallel (typically 8-64 heads)
- Each attention head can potentially learn to focus on different parts of input sequence
- Captures various aspects or relationships within data simultaneously
- Each head processes independently, making it efficient for parallel computation on GPUs/TPUs

**Key Insight:** Multiple attention heads allow for attending to parts of the sequence differently, such as longer-term dependencies versus shorter-term dependencies - mirroring how human attention operates across multiple timescales.

## 2. Hierarchical Processing Architecture

### 2.1 Layer-by-Layer Abstraction Building

**Validated Parallel:** Both human brains and transformers build increasingly abstract representations through hierarchical processing stages.

**Neuroscience Evidence:**
- More distant intelligibility-sensitive regions within superior and middle temporal gyri, hippocampus, and left inferior frontal gyrus show insensitivity to acoustic form, suggesting more abstract nonacoustic processes
- Hierarchically, frontoparietal cortices predict higher-level, longer-range representations compared to temporal cortices
- Consistent with cognitive models and auditory processing in nonhuman primates

**Transformer Layer Architecture:**
- Large language models rely on transformers employing multiple attention layers to capture intricate relationships in input data
- Hierarchical architecture enables selective focus on different parts of sequence, enhancing contextual understanding
- Each layer builds on representations from previous layers, creating progressively abstract features

**Brain-Model Correspondence (2024 Research):**
- Most powerful transformer models predict nearly 100% of explainable variance in neural responses to sentences
- Generalize across different datasets and imaging modalities (fMRI and electrocorticography)
- GPT-2 consistently outperforms all other models in explaining brain activity variance
- Arguably most cognitively plausible because it uses unidirectional, forward attention

### 2.2 Predictive Processing: The Shared Computational Framework

**Strong Validated Parallel:** Both systems optimize for next-element prediction and minimize prediction errors.

**Neuroscience Framework:**
- The brain's language system is optimized for predictive processing in the service of meaning extraction
- Predictive coding paradigm suggests the brain constantly makes predictions during perception and compares these with perceived signals
- Prediction error is measured as the distance between predicted and actual signals
- N400 brain response arises from prediction error propagation during language processing

**Transformer Computational Principles (2024 ECoG Study):**
Research using electrocorticography found human brain and autoregressive deep language models share THREE fundamental computational principles:
1. **Continuous next-word prediction** before word onset
2. **Matching pre-onset predictions** to incoming words to calculate post-onset surprise
3. **Contextual embeddings** to represent words

**Model-Brain Correspondence:**
- Models' neural fits ("brain score") and fits to behavioral responses are strongly correlated with model accuracy on next-word prediction task
- This provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that human language understanding computations are optimized for predictive processing

**Recent 2024 Research:**
A neuro-cognitive model proposes language comprehension relies on two key mechanisms: **prediction and unification**. The model shows ERPs such as N400 and P600 arise as side effects of an error-based learning mechanism.

## 3. Memory Systems and Context Management

### 3.1 Working Memory vs. Context Window

**Functional Similarity with Critical Limitations:**

**Human Working Memory:**
- Short-term buffering is one component of a more complex working memory network engaged in reasoning and goal-directed behavior
- Subject to capacity limitations (Miller's 7±2 items, or more recent estimates of 4±1 chunks)
- Adaptive forgetting mechanism prevents cognitive overload and helps prioritize important information
- Information shaped by emotional weight and personal experience

**Transformer Context Window:**
- Described by researchers as "a kind of working memory" that allows model to hold and track information
- Theoretical capacity now reaches 1M+ tokens in some models
- Working memory is an important bottleneck in transformer-based LLMs

**Critical Limitation - The Working Memory Bottleneck:**
Long before information exceeds context window size, the transformer's ability to effectively represent and communicate this information is exceeded. **For many problems with complex context, the LLM's effective working memory can get overloaded with relatively small inputs—far before hitting context window limits.**

**Lost-in-the-Middle Problem:**
A 2023 finding shows LLMs don't "robustly make use of information in long input contexts"—models perform best when relevant information is at beginning or end. This mirrors human serial position effects (primacy and recency).

**Computational Constraints:**
Compute requirements scale quadratically with sequence length: if input tokens double, model needs 4× processing power, constraining effective working memory beyond theoretical limits.

### 3.2 Semantic Memory and Embedding Spaces

**Functional Parallel with Mechanistic Differences:**

**Human Semantic Memory:**
- Stores general truths and common knowledge
- Retrieval based on relevance, emotional significance, and experiential connections
- Subject to adaptive forgetting and continuous updating
- Deeply personal and shaped by individual experience

**LLM Parametric Memory:**
- Parametric long-term memory embeds factual knowledge within model parameters
- Forms internalized knowledge base corresponding to semantic memory
- Retrieval based on statistical likelihood rather than relevance or emotional significance
- Vector embeddings capture semantic meaning as numeric representations

**Retrieval Mechanisms:**
- Both use similarity-based retrieval (human: semantic associations; LLM: cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product)
- By calculating similarity scores between query embeddings and knowledge embeddings, systems identify contextually relevant information

**Critical Difference:**
LLMs store information as patterns encoded in parameters and retrieve based on statistical likelihood, **not relevance or emotional significance**. LLMs have no concept of importance or personal experience, whereas human memory is deeply personal and shaped by emotional weight.

## 4. Scaling and Emergent Abilities

### 4.1 Model Scale and Brain Correspondence

**Scaling Laws in Both Domains:**

**Neural Language Models:**
- Linear relationship between logarithm of parameter count and ability to predict fMRI time-courses
- Left-right brain asymmetry emerges when encoding models based on increasingly complex models
- Finding replicates scaling laws between model size and brain score
- More complex models (up to 14.2B parameters) better recover brain lateralization patterns

**Key Study (2024):**
Analysis of 28 pretrained models from 8 different families (124M to 14.2B parameters) shows that model complexity directly correlates with ability to predict human brain activity patterns during language processing.

---

### 4.2 Emergent Cognitive Abilities

**Definition:** An ability is emergent if it is not present in smaller models but appears in larger models. Performance shows near-random results until a critical threshold, then increases substantially.

**2024 Research Findings:**

**Debate on True Emergence:**
Recent 2024 ACL paper challenges emergence narrative through 1000+ experiments, finding that purported emergent abilities result from:
- In-context learning
- Model memory
- Linguistic knowledge

Rather than truly emergent phenomena, these may be **combinations of capabilities** that become effective at scale.

**Alternative Perspective:**
2024 NAACL study shows models trained on simplified pre-training data demonstrate enhanced zero-shot capabilities, achieving performance comparable to models 6× larger, suggesting **emergent properties aren't strictly tied to raw size**.

**Recent Model Capabilities (o1 vs GPT-4o):**
- Competition Math (AIME 2024): o1 = 83.3%, GPT-4o = 13.4%
- Codeforces programming: o1 = 89.0%, GPT-4o = 11.0%
- Planning, self-reflection, and strategic thinking became emergent abilities in new generation

## 5. Theory of Mind and Social Cognition

### 5.1 Current State of Theory of Mind in LLMs (2024)

**Mixed Evidence:** The question of whether LLMs possess Theory of Mind (ToM) has sparked significant scientific debate with mixed evidence.

**Major 2024 Study Findings:**

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- ChatGPT-4 (June 2023) solved 75% of false-belief tasks using 40 bespoke tests
- Performance matches 6-year-old children observed in past studies
- LLMs can mirror human performance on most ToM tasks when tested on comprehensive batteries

**EPITOME Battery:**
Developed battery of six experiments tapping diverse ToM capacities:
- Belief attribution
- Emotional inference
- Pragmatic reasoning

**The Core Debate:**
Major reason for disagreement on whether LLMs have ToM: **lack of clarity on whether models should match human behaviors, or the computations underlying those behaviors**.

**Mechanistic Understanding (2024):**
Research reveals ToM capabilities emerge from extremely sparse parameter patterns—perturbing as little as 0.001% of parameters significantly degrades ToM performance.

**Consensus:** Evidence suggests LLMs can pattern-match ToM behaviors but may lack genuine understanding of mental states that humans possess.

## 6. Fundamental Architectural Differences

### 6.1 Learning Mechanisms: Backpropagation vs. Predictive Coding

**Critical Difference:** While both systems aim to minimize prediction errors, they use fundamentally different mechanisms.

**Backpropagation (Transformers):**
- Computes gradient in weight space with respect to loss function
- Assigns blame by multiplying error signals with all synaptic weights downstream
- Requires precise, symmetric backward connectivity pattern
- **Biologically implausible:** Change in each synaptic weight calculated as complex, global function of activities and weights of many neurons

**Predictive Coding (Brain):**
- Networks perform supervised learning autonomously using simple local Hebbian plasticity
- For certain parameters, weight changes converge to backpropagation algorithm results
- Only local computation and biological plasticity required
- Prospective configuration reduces interference better than backpropagation

**Key Insight:** Unlike backpropagation where weights change directly to minimize errors, energy-based brain models first clamp output neurons to target, modify neural activity to minimize energy function, then update weights.

**Consensus:** It is unlikely that brain networks implement backpropagation algorithm exactly. The brain likely uses prediction error-based mechanisms like predictive coding that are more biologically plausible.

### 6.2 Causal Reasoning Limitations

**Major Limitation Identified in 2024 Research:**

**Two Levels of Causal Reasoning:**
1. **Level-1 (Shallow):** LLMs can perform this - based on causal knowledge embedded in parameters
2. **Level-2 (Deep):** LLMs lack this - genuine human-like causal reasoning

**Specific Challenges:**
- Struggle with complex causal structures
- Difficulty with confounding variables
- Cannot reliably distinguish correlation from causation
- Significant performance drop on fresh data (CausalProbe-2024) vs. memorized benchmarks

**Architectural Issues:**
- Transformer-based architectures prone to learning demographic biases and social stereotypes during pre-training
- Hinders ability to grasp deeper causal relationships or engage in logical reasoning
- **Autoregression mechanism is not inherently causal**
- No forward-looking mechanism or unique causal logic built into systems

**Key Finding:** While LLMs can recognize patterns and provide plausible causal explanations based on memorized knowledge, they **lack genuine causal reasoning capabilities** for novel contexts.

### 6.3 Compositional Understanding Challenges

**Definition:** Compositionality is the ability to understand complex meanings by systematically combining simpler components.

**Transformers and Compositionality:**
- Transformers are "extremely unbiased learners with no explicit rule-like representations or built-in sensitivity to constituent structure"
- Standard architectures including transformers exhibit reduced performance on compositional tests
- Less extreme than convolutional neural networks, but still problematic

**Recent 2025 Research:**
Research on Compositional Reasoning Questions (CRQ) - evaluating Boolean formulas and multi-step word problems - finds that transformers, RNNs, and chain-of-thought approaches **cannot solve CRQs unless hyperparameters like depth, embedding dimension, or chain-of-thought tokens grow with input size**.

**Novel Compounds Challenge:**
Novel compounds pose challenges even for pretrained Transformer models. Composition exposure during pretraining influences generalization performance.

**Brain-Inspired Alternative:**
The Causal Cognitive Architecture (brain-inspired) uses spatial navigation maps as fundamental circuits. A modest change to this architecture resulted in **emergence of compositionality**, suggesting alternative architectures might better support compositional understanding.

2. **Hierarchical Structure:** Information organization from simple to complex aids both systems
3. **Predictive Processing:** Providing context that enables prediction improves performance
4. **Working Memory Limits:** Both systems have practical capacity constraints despite theoretical limits
5. **Semantic Retrieval:** Similarity-based information retrieval works similarly

**Practical Implications:**

- Use semantic similarity for retrieval-augmented generation

---

### 7.2 Misleading Analogies to Avoid

**❌ Weak or Contradicted Evidence:**
1. **"Understanding" like humans:** LLMs pattern-match rather than comprehend meaning
2. **Causal reasoning:** Only shallow (level-1) causal capabilities, not genuine causal inference
3. **Theory of mind:** Can mimic ToM behaviors but lack genuine mental state understanding
4. **Compositional generalization:** Struggle with novel compositions despite training exposure
5. **Emotional significance:** No concept of importance, emotional weight, or personal experience

**Framework Design Warnings:**
- Don't assume LLMs "understand" concepts the way humans do
- Don't rely on deep causal reasoning for novel situations
- Don't expect genuine perspective-taking or empathy
- Don't assume compositional abilities generalize to unfamiliar combinations
- Don't treat model responses as reflecting genuine beliefs or values

---

### 7.3 Architectural Differences to Respect

**Key Differences:**
1. **Learning:** Backpropagation (non-local) vs. local Hebbian plasticity (brain)
2. **Causality:** Statistical correlation vs. causal understanding
3. **Memory:** Statistical patterns vs. experiential significance
4. **Processing:** Token-by-token prediction vs. holistic understanding
5. **Embodiment:** Disembodied text vs. sensorimotor grounding

**Framework Design Principles:**
- Provide explicit causal structure when needed (don't assume inference)
- Emphasize statistical patterns and correlations in training data
- Don't assume experiential learning or embodied understanding
- Support token-by-token processing with clear sequential structure
- Compensate for lack of sensorimotor grounding with explicit descriptions
