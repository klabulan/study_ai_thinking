# BRUTAL ROAST: "Why Reasoning Models Make You Overthink (And Cost 100x More)"

## VERDICT: 4/10 - Repackaged news with forced cognitive angle and cherry-picked drama

---

## 1. Actually Current? **FAILED**

**Your claim**: "New insight for 2025"

**Reality**: This is literally just summarizing what everyone learned in September 2024 when o1 dropped, with April 2025 o3/o4-mini details sprinkled on top.

- **o1 simple prompts > complex prompts**: Known since Sept 2024. Microsoft already wrote the definitive guide. You're 6+ months late.
- **Cost explosion**: Everyone who uses reasoning models already knows this. It's not a revelation—it's in the pricing page.
- **OverThink attacks**: Published February 2025 (arXiv 2502.02542). You're just rehashing academic research from 7 months ago.

**What's actually new here?** Nothing. You're writing "here's what reasoning models are like" in September 2025 when the world figured this out a year ago.

---

## 2. Gerlich Study Real? **VERIFIED BUT WEAK HOOK**

**Your claim**: "Gerlich 2025 links AI use to critical thinking decline"

**Reality**: Yes, the study exists (published Jan 3, 2025 in *Societies* journal). BUT:

- **r = -0.75 correlation** - strong correlation, NOT causation
- **666 UK participants** with self-reported critical thinking assessments
- Study focuses on **general AI tool usage** (ChatGPT, Grammarly, etc.), NOT specifically reasoning models
- The connection between "AI cognitive offloading" and "reasoning model cost management" is YOUR invention, not Gerlich's

**Problem**: You're taking a study about ChatGPT making people lazy thinkers and forcing it to be about o1 pricing strategies. These are different topics.

**Better hook would be**: "The study shows AI makes people dumb, but reasoning models make YOU pay 100x more to become equally dumb faster."

---

## 3. Cognitive Offloading Angle Forced? **EXTREMELY FORCED**

**Your claim**: Cognitive offloading framework illuminates the problem

**Reality**: You're conflating three unrelated concepts:

1. **Human cognitive offloading** (Gerlich): People delegate critical thinking to AI tools, skills atrophy
2. **AI model reasoning internalization** (o1/o3): Models think internally vs externally in prompt
3. **Cost management** (practical problem): Reasoning models cost 10-100x more per token

**The stretch**:
- Humans externalize reasoning because working memory limits (7±2 chunks, Miller 1956)
- AI reasoning models internalize reasoning... but this has NOTHING to do with working memory limits
- Cost explosion happens because more tokens = more money

**These three things don't actually relate.** You're forcing a cognitive metaphor onto an economic problem. It's like saying "Just like humans need sleep, reasoning models need bigger AWS bills."

---

## 4. Cost Management Boring? **PAINFULLY BORING**

**Your claim**: Decision tree for when reasoning is worth the cost

**Reality**: Every PM already has this "decision tree" - it's called their budget spreadsheet.

**The actual decision tree**:
```
Is this task worth 10-100x cost?
├─ Yes → Use reasoning model
└─ No → Use regular model
```

**What you'll probably write**:
- "Assess task complexity" (no shit)
- "Evaluate cost vs accuracy tradeoffs" (obvious)
- "Use reasoning for high-stakes decisions" (duh)
- "Monitor token consumption" (everyone already does this)

**What would make this NOT boring**:
- Quantified breakeven analysis with real pricing data
- Industry benchmarks: "At X task complexity, reasoning pays for itself"
- Comparative case studies: "Company Y saved $50K by switching from o1 to GPT-4o for 70% of tasks"
- Tools/frameworks for automated routing

**But you won't have this data.** So it'll be generic advice PMs already know.

---

## 5. Audience Cares? **QUESTIONABLE**

**Your claim**: Engineers/PMs managing AI budgets need this

**Reality check**:

**PMs don't need blog posts about cost management. They need**:
- Actual billing alerts in their OpenAI dashboard
- ROI calculators with their specific use cases
- Benchmarks from their competitors
- Budget approval from finance

**Engineers don't need essays about overthinking. They need**:
- Model routing libraries
- Caching strategies
- Prompt optimization tools
- Actual code examples

**Who might care**:
- Founders burning through VC money who just got their OpenAI bill
- Content writers looking for AI drama to write about
- Other bloggers farming engagement

**But do they need YOUR blog post vs just reading OpenAI's pricing page?** No.

---

## 6. 100x Claim Accurate? **CHERRY-PICKED EXTREME**

**Your claim**: "Cost 100x More"

**Reality**: Let's check actual pricing (OpenAI, Sept 2025):

**GPT-4o**:
- Input: $2.50 per 1M tokens
- Output: $10 per 1M tokens

**o1**:
- Input: $15 per 1M tokens (6x more, not 100x)
- Output: $60 per 1M tokens (6x more)

**o1-mini**:
- Input: $3 per 1M tokens (1.2x)
- Output: $12 per 1M tokens (1.2x)

**Where's the 100x?**
- Maybe if you compare o1 output tokens ($60) to GPT-4o-mini input tokens ($0.15)? That's 400x!
- Or if you count reasoning token overhead (10-20x more tokens generated)?
- Or if you cherry-pick the worst possible comparison?

**The honest claim**: "Reasoning models cost 6x more per token and generate 10x more tokens, leading to ~60x cost increase for complex reasoning tasks."

**But "60x" is less clickbait-y than "100x"**, so you rounded up.

---

## 7. Differentiation Real? **MINIMAL**

**Your claim**: This is different from existing "reasoning models are expensive" takes

**Existing coverage**:
- **Sebastian Raschka** (Jan 2025): Comprehensive analysis of test-time compute and inference scaling
- **Microsoft Azure AI blog** (Feb 2025): Official guide to o1/o3-mini prompting and cost optimization
- **PromptHub** (ongoing): Practical prompt engineering with reasoning models
- **Apple ML Research** (2025): "The Illusion of Thinking" - understanding when reasoning helps

**What you're adding**:
- Cognitive offloading metaphor (forced)
- Gerlich study (tangentially related)
- "OverThink attacks" (academic research from Feb 2025)
- "Decision tree" (generic advice)

**Honest assessment**: You're synthesizing existing research with a cognitive science wrapper. The cognitive angle is your unique contribution, but it's not a natural fit—it's forced because you want to be different.

**Actual differentiation**: Zero. You're just repackaging known information with a psychology hook.

---

## 8. Actionable Framework? **VAGUE VIBES**

**Your claim**: Provides decision tree for when reasoning is worth the cost

**What you'll probably deliver**:

```
Task Complexity Assessment:
- Low complexity → Use GPT-4o
- Medium complexity → Consider o1-mini
- High complexity → Use o1 or o3

Cost-Benefit Analysis:
- Evaluate accuracy requirements
- Consider token budget
- Monitor performance metrics

Best Practices:
- Start with simple prompts
- Avoid complex prompt engineering
- Use reasoning strategically
```

**Problems**:
- No quantified thresholds ("low/medium/high complexity" - based on what?)
- No actual decision tree algorithm
- No cost calculator
- No benchmarks
- No code
- Just vibes

**What an actually actionable framework would include**:
```python
def should_use_reasoning_model(
    task_complexity_score: float,  # 0-100
    max_budget: float,              # dollars
    accuracy_requirement: float,    # 0-1
    latency_tolerance: int          # seconds
) -> str:
    # Actual logic here with real thresholds
    pass
```

**You won't deliver this.** You'll deliver platitudes.

## 9. Overthinking Framing Works? **CLICKBAIT MISDIRECTION**

**Your claim**: "Make You Overthink" as the angle

**Reality**: This is linguistic sleight-of-hand.

**Two different meanings of "overthink"**:
1. **Humans overthink** (cognitive offloading): Gerlich study about reliance on AI
2. **AI models overthink** (OverThink attacks): Models generate excessive reasoning tokens

**Your title conflates these**: "Reasoning Models Make You Overthink"

**What it implies**: Using reasoning models causes humans to overthink (psychological effect)

**What you actually mean**: Reasoning models internally overthink (generate excessive tokens), which costs money

**This is intellectually dishonest framing.** You're using cognitive science vocabulary to describe an economic problem because it sounds smarter than "Reasoning models are expensive."

**Honest title**: "Reasoning Models Overthink (And Cost 10x More)"

**Even more honest title**: "Reasoning Models Generate More Tokens, Which Costs More Money"

## 10. Predicted 8-9/10 Realistic? **DELUSIONAL OPTIMISM**

**Your prediction**: This will stand out as 8-9/10

**Reality check**:

**What makes content stand out**:
- Novel insights (you have none)
- Original research (you're citing others)
- Practical tools (you'll have generic advice)
- Unique perspective (cognitive framing is forced)
- Actionable value (decision tree will be vague)

**What you actually have**:
- ✅ Real research (Gerlich, OverThink attacks)
- ✅ Timely topic (reasoning models)
- ❌ Novel angle (forced cognitive metaphor)
- ❌ Actionable framework (generic advice)
- ❌ Differentiation (repackaging known info)

**Likely outcome**:
- Gets 500-2000 views from HN/Reddit if you post it
- Sparks debate in comments about whether cognitive offloading actually relates to reasoning model costs
- Gets overshadowed by more practical cost optimization posts with actual code/tools
- Fades into the sea of "here's what reasoning models are like" content

**Actual rating**: 5-6/10 content that will get engagement for controversy (forced metaphor) but won't provide lasting value.

---

## THE CORE PROBLEM

You're trying to connect three unrelated things:

1. **Gerlich study**: AI makes humans lazy thinkers (cognitive offloading)
2. **Reasoning models**: Internalize thinking, generate more tokens
3. **Cost explosion**: More tokens = higher bills

**Your thesis**: "Humans externalize reasoning (working memory limits), AI internalizes reasoning (internal CoT), which triggers over-reliance (cognitive offloading), creating cost explosion."

**The problem**:
- AI doesn't internalize reasoning because of working memory limits (it has none)
- Cognitive offloading happens with ALL AI tools, not specifically reasoning models
- Cost explosion is caused by token count, not cognitive offloading
- The connection is superficial wordplay, not deep insight

**It's like writing**: "Just as humans need food for energy (biology), AI needs electricity for compute (physics), which causes obesity (health crisis) because we eat while using AI (behavioral psychology)."

**All the facts are true, but the connection is nonsense.**

## HOW TO FIX IT

### Option A: Commit to the Cognitive Angle (Hard Mode)

Investigate the ACTUAL cognitive relationship:
- Do teams using reasoning models become MORE dependent on AI for critical thinking vs teams using standard models?
- Does the "hidden thinking" (internal CoT) make users trust outputs without verification?
- Are there cognitive biases specific to reasoning model usage?
- Survey data, interviews, original research

**This is a REAL blog post.** But it requires months of research.

### Option B: Commit to the Cost Management Angle (Practical Mode)

Forget the cognitive metaphor. Write the PM guide:
- Quantified cost comparison across model families
- Breakeven analysis for different task types
- Real company case studies with numbers
- Open-source router/orchestrator comparison
- Actual decision tree with thresholds

**This is useful.** But it's boring to write.

### Option C: Commit to the Technical Angle (Hacker Mode)

Deep dive into OverThink attacks:
- How do they work mechanically?
- Can you reproduce them?
- How do providers defend against them?
- Build a tool to detect/prevent them

**This stands out.** But requires technical depth.

### Option D: Commit to the Controversy Angle (Spicy Mode)

"The reasoning model scam: Why o1 is just GPT-4o with expensive built-in CoT"
- Investigate whether reasoning models are actually novel architectures or just prompt engineering at scale
- Cost/benefit analysis showing most use cases don't need reasoning
- Interview engineers who downgraded from o1 to GPT-4o

**This gets engagement.** But might piss off OpenAI fans.

## FINAL ROAST RATING: 4/10

**What works**:
- ✅ Gerlich study is real and timely (Jan 2025)
- ✅ OverThink attacks are real research (Feb 2025)
- ✅ Cost concerns are legitimate (everyone complains about o1 bills)
- ✅ Title is clickable

**What fails**:
- ❌ Not actually current (Sept 2024 news repackaged)
- ❌ Cognitive angle is forced, not illuminating
- ❌ Decision tree will be generic platitudes
- ❌ Zero differentiation from existing coverage
- ❌ 100x claim is cherry-picked extreme
- ❌ "Make you overthink" is linguistic misdirection
- ❌ Framework won't be actionable without real data/code

**Will it stand out?**

No. It'll be another "reasoning models are expensive and different from regular models" post in a sea of similar content. The cognitive offloading angle is too forced to provide genuine insight.

**Should you write it?**

Only if you commit to ONE of the fix options above. Otherwise, you're just creating content for the sake of content—mixing Gerlich + OverThink attacks + generic cost advice doesn't produce a cohesive argument.

**The brutal truth**:

You're pattern-matching "cognitive science + AI" because those posts worked before. But this particular combination doesn't naturally fit together. The connections are superficial. You'd spend 20 hours writing something that adds minimal value to the discourse.

**Better alternative**:

Write about the mental model confusion problem (Section 9 in your research). THAT'S the actual cognitive angle with reasoning models—users can't form accurate mental models when models internalize thinking. That's novel, under-explored, and actually related to cognitive science.

Or just write the practical cost optimization guide and skip the cognitive framing entirely. PMs will thank you more for a spreadsheet than a philosophy essay.
