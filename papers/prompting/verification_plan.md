# Prompting Framework Verification Plan

## Purpose
Systematically verify, research, and improve the foundational concepts of a new-generation prompting framework based on AI-human cognitive parallels and latest AI research insights.

---

## Group 1: AI-Human Cognitive Parallels

### Core Concepts to Verify
- Common patterns between AI and human thinking processes
- Cognitive science techniques applicable to AI prompting
- Differences between AI and human cognitive processes
- Transferability of human communication techniques to LLM interactions

### Research Questions
1. What are the verified cognitive science parallels between human information processing and LLM mechanisms?
2. Which human communication techniques have proven effectiveness in prompting contexts?
3. Where do AI and human cognition fundamentally diverge, requiring different approaches?
4. What recent studies (2023-2025) validate or challenge these parallels?

### Verification Sources Needed
- Cognitive science research on language processing and attention
- Recent AI interpretability studies (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind)
- Comparative studies on human vs AI reasoning patterns
- Neuroscience of language comprehension vs transformer architectures

### Expected Outcomes
- List of validated cognitive parallels with academic backing
- Identification of misleading analogies to avoid
- Framework for when to use human-like vs AI-specific prompting approaches

## Group 2: Prompting Effectiveness Mechanisms

### Core Concepts to Verify
- Why certain prompting techniques work (mechanistic explanations)
- Relationship between prompt structure and model behavior
- Effectiveness patterns across different model architectures
- Interaction with thinking vs non-thinking models
- Context length impact on prompting strategies

### Research Questions
1. What do we know from AI research about how prompts affect model behavior at the mechanistic level?
2. Which prompting techniques have empirical validation vs anecdotal support?
3. How do prompting strategies differ between models with/without extended reasoning capabilities?
4. What are the theoretical limits of prompting effectiveness?

### Verification Sources Needed
- Studies on prompt engineering effectiveness (academic and industry)
- Chain-of-thought and reasoning research
- Model architecture papers (attention mechanisms, context windows)
- Empirical prompting studies with controlled experiments
- Analysis of thinking models (o1, o3) vs standard models

### Expected Outcomes
- Evidence-based taxonomy of prompting techniques
- Mechanistic understanding of why techniques work
- Clear guidelines for technique selection based on model type

## Group 3: Practical Framework Architecture

### Core Concepts to Verify
- Existing prompting frameworks and their limitations
- Coverage requirements (one-shot, agents, long-context, system prompts)
- Multi-audience approach feasibility (scientists, engineers, general users)
- Integration of theoretical principles with practical techniques

### Research Questions
1. What are the current state-of-the-art prompting frameworks and their blind spots?
2. Can a unified framework serve theoretical and practical audiences effectively?
3. What structure enables both academic rigor and practical applicability?
4. How to balance generality with specific use case optimization?

### Verification Sources Needed
- Review of existing prompting frameworks (academic and commercial)
- Analysis of successful prompting documentation (Anthropic, OpenAI, community resources)
- Educational design research on technical skill transfer
- Industry case studies on prompting adoption patterns

### Expected Outcomes
- Gap analysis of existing frameworks
- Proposed architecture for multi-level framework
- Validation of deliverable structure (papers, blog posts, practical guides)

## Verification Methodology

### For Each Group:

1. **Literature Search**
   - Academic databases (arXiv, Google Scholar, PubMed for cognitive science)
   - Industry research publications
   - Verified technical blogs and documentation
   - Recent conference papers (NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, CogSci)

2. **Critical Analysis**
   - Assess source credibility and recency
   - Identify conflicting evidence
   - Distinguish established knowledge from speculation
   - Note gaps requiring original research

3. **Synthesis**
   - Extract verified insights
   - Identify areas needing clarification or additional research
   - Propose improvements to original concept
   - Document open questions

4. **Integration**
   - Connect findings across groups
   - Identify synergies and conflicts
   - Refine overall framework vision
   - Update audience and deliverable definitions
