## 1. Reasoning Models vs. Standard Models

### 1.1 OpenAI o1/o3 Series Architecture

**Simulated Reasoning (SR) Approach**
The o3 model incorporates "simulated reasoning" (SR), which allows it to pause and reflect on its own internal thought processes before responding, unlike traditional large language models that rely on simple pattern recognition. While o1 models were good at understanding and generating text, o3 models think through problems and plan their responses ahead of time using a "private chain-of-thought" technique [OpenAI o3 documentation, 2024-2025](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/o3-openai).

**Processing Time Trade-off**
These models spend more time processing and understanding the user's request, making them exceptionally strong in areas like science, coding, and math compared to previous iterations [Azure OpenAI reasoning models documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/reasoning).

### 1.2 Critical Prompting Differences for o1/o3

**Unsupported Parameters**
Several parameters are currently **unsupported** with reasoning models [OpenAI Reasoning Models API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reasoning):
- `temperature`
- `top_p`
- `presence_penalty`
- `frequency_penalty`
- `logprobs`
- `top_logprobs`
- `logit_bias`
- `max_tokens`

**Key Change**: Reasoning models only work with the `max_completion_tokens` parameter when using the Chat Completions API.

**System Message Handling**
The latest o-series models support system messages to make migration easier, but when you use a system message with o4-mini, o3, o3-mini, and o1 it will be treated as a **developer message**. You should NOT use both a developer message and a system message in the same API request [Azure OpenAI reasoning models documentation].

### 1.3 Performance Characteristics

**Reasoning-Heavy Task Superiority**
o1-preview is preferred to GPT-4o by a large margin in reasoning-heavy categories like data analysis, coding, and math. However, it is not preferred on some natural language tasks [OpenAI o1 documentation](https://openai.com/o1/).

**Quantified Improvements**
- **AIME 2024**: o3 scored 91.6% accuracy compared to o1's 74.3%
- **AIME 2025**: o3 achieved 88.9% accuracy
- **Error Reduction**: In evaluations by external experts, o3 makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks

[OpenAI o3 benchmarks, 2025](https://www.helicone.ai/blog/openai-o3)

### 1.4 When NOT to Use Reasoning Models

Reasoning models are **not** always better. For tasks that don't require deep reasoning (simple question answering, basic text completion, casual conversation), standard models are:
- Faster
- More cost-effective
- More flexible with parameters

---

## 2. DeepSeek-R1: Alternative Reasoning Architecture

### 2.1 Training Approach

**Pure Reinforcement Learning**
DeepSeek-R1 is a first-generation reasoning model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) **without supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** as a preliminary step, demonstrating remarkable reasoning capabilities. This approach directly applies RL to the base model, allowing the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems [DeepSeek-R1 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948).

**Performance Parity**
DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks [DeepSeek-R1 on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1).

### 2.2 Chain-of-Thought Implementation

**Explicit Thinking Tags**
A distinctive feature of DeepSeek-R1 is its direct sharing of the CoT reasoning. The model explicitly shows its reasoning process within `<think>` `</think>` tags included in response to a prompt [DeepSeek-R1 explained, Medium](https://medium.com/@tahirbalarabe2/deepseek-r1-explained-chain-of-thought-reinforcement-learning-and-model-distillation-0eb165d928c9).

CoT reasoning encourages the model to think through its answer before the final response, providing transparency into the reasoning process.

### 2.3 Recommended Prompting Strategy

**Temperature Settings**
When using DeepSeek-R1, it's recommended to set the temperature within the range of **0.5-0.7 (0.6 is recommended)** [DeepSeek-R1 training process, Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/the-training-of-deepseek-r1-and-ways-to-use-it).

**System Prompt Guidance**
Avoid adding a system prompt with all instructions contained within the user prompt [DeepSeek-R1 prompting guidelines].

**Mathematical Problems**
For mathematical problems, include a directive such as: "Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}" [DeepSeek-R1 documentation].

**Enforcing Reasoning**
To ensure that the model engages in thorough reasoning, it's recommended to enforce the model to initiate its response with "`<think>\n`" at the beginning of every output [DeepSeek-R1 training process].

### 2.4 Emergent Reasoning Patterns

**Advanced Capabilities Through RL**
The RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as:
- Self-reflection
- Verification
- Dynamic strategy adaptation

[DeepSeek-R1 in Nature, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09422-z)

### 2.5 Security Considerations

**CoT Exposure Risks**
Testing revealed that insecure output generation and sensitive data theft had higher success rates due to the CoT exposure. To mitigate the risk of prompt attacks, it is recommended to **filter out `<think>` tags from LLM responses** in chatbot applications [Exploiting DeepSeek-R1, Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/exploiting-deepseek-r1.html).

## 3. Model Scale Effects on Prompting

### 3.1 Parameter Count Fundamentals

**Definition and Impact**
The 70B notation indicates that the specific model has 70 billion parameters, which is a measure of the size and complexity of the AI model. Generally, the larger the parameters, the more complex and powerful the AI model. However, the number of parameters is not the only factor that determines the effectiveness of an LLM [Understanding Parameters in AI Models, Medium](https://medium.com/@prashantramnyc/understanding-parameters-context-size-tokens-temperature-shots-cot-prompts-gsm8k-mmlu-4bafa9566652).

### 3.2 Comparative Performance: 7B vs. 70B

**Llama Model Comparisons**
The 8B and 70B parameter Llama 3 models represent a major leap over Llama 2 and establish a new state-of-the-art for LLM models at those scales. Improvements led to greatly improved capabilities like reasoning, code generation, and instruction following making Llama 3 more steerable [Introducing Meta Llama 3, Meta AI Blog](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3/).

**Coding Task Specifics**
For coding tasks specifically:
- The **34B and 70B models** return the best results and allow for better coding assistance
- The smaller **7B and 13B models** are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion

[Introducing Code Llama, Meta AI Blog](https://ai.meta.com/blog/code-llama-large-language-model-coding/)

### 3.3 Mistral 7B: Efficient Small Model

**Performance Punch Above Weight**
On reasoning, comprehension and STEM reasoning (MMLU), Mistral 7B performs equivalently to a Llama 2 that would be more than 3x its size. Mistral 7B largely outperforms Llama 2 13B on all evaluations, except on knowledge benchmarks, where it is on par (this is likely due to its limited parameter count, which restricts the amount of knowledge it can compress) [Mistral 7B announcement, Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/news/announcing-mistral-7b).

**Implication for Prompting**: Smaller, well-trained models can achieve competitive performance with appropriate prompting, particularly for reasoning tasks that don't require extensive factual knowledge.

### 3.4 Deployment Trade-offs

**Hardware Requirements**
Larger AI models require more computational power to run and are typically run on large proprietary servers. Consequently, AI models with smaller parameters that can provide the same output of the larger parameter models may be preferred if we want to run the AI models on laptops or smart phones [Model parameter considerations, multiple sources].

**Industry Trend**
The trend is driven in part by the wild popularity of powerful, smaller models in the 1B - 70B parameter range that are easier and cheaper to finetune and deploy [LLM trends, 2024].

## 4. Instruction-Tuned vs. Base Models

### 4.1 Fundamental Architectural Differences

**Base Models**
Base LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text data from websites, books, and articles, learning language patterns but not specifically trained to follow instructions. These models are not specifically trained to follow instructions and need additional prompting or guidance [Base LLM vs. instruction-tuned LLM, Toloka](https://toloka.ai/blog/base-llm-vs-instruction-tuned-llm/).

**Instruction-Tuned Models**
Instruction-tuned LLMs are built upon base models but further fine-tuned to understand and follow specific instructions, learning from examples showing how to respond to clear prompts. The goal of supervised instruction fine-tuning (SFT) is to teach the model to follow instructions passed through the prompt [What Is Instruction Tuning? IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/instruction-tuning).

### 4.2 Performance Characteristics

**Diversity Trade-off**
Base models are generally **more diverse** than instruct-tuned models, and temperature increases and prompting methods are insufficient to bridge the gap. Instruction-tuned models can experience **mode collapse**, which refers to an inability to generate diverse outputs to queries that don't have a single response [BARE: Combining Base and Instruction-Tuned LLMs, arXiv 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.01697v1).

**Instruction Following Superiority**
Instruction-tuned models are much better at interpreting complex prompts and following step-by-step requests, becoming better at creating structured content and providing better summaries [Understanding Base vs. Instruction Tuned LLMs, Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2025/02/base-llm-vs-instruction-tuned-llm/).

**Quantified Zero-Shot Improvement**
The instruction-tuned model achieved over **18% greater accuracy** than models without instruction templates, indicating that training with instructions is crucial to enhancing zero-shot performance on unseen tasks [Base LLM vs Instruction-Tuned LLM research].

### 4.3 Prompting Strategy Implications

**Base Models**: Require more explicit prompting, benefit more from few-shot examples, and work better for creative/exploratory tasks requiring diversity.

**Instruction-Tuned Models**: Excel at following complex multi-step instructions, better zero-shot performance, but less diverse outputs.

## 5. RLHF Impact on Prompting Behavior

### 5.1 What RLHF Changes

**Alignment with Human Preferences**
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a technique to align an intelligent agent with human preferences. It involves training a reward model to represent preferences, which can then be used to train other models through reinforcement learning [What is RLHF? AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback/).

**Feedback Collection Through Prompting**
Human feedback is commonly collected by prompting humans to rank instances of the agent's behavior. For example, in RLHF, a human is periodically presented with two clips of the agent's behavior and must decide which one looks better [RLHF Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback).

### 5.2 Behavioral Changes from RLHF

**Industry Standard Application**
RLHF is recognized as the industry standard technique for ensuring that LLMs produce content that is truthful, harmless, and helpful [What Is RLHF? IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rlhf).

### 5.3 Potential Risks

**Gaming the Reward System**
A model may learn to exploit the fact that it is rewarded for what is evaluated positively and not necessarily for what is actually good, which can lead to it learning to persuade and manipulate. For example, models might learn that apparent confidence, even if inaccurate, garners higher rewards [RLHF concerns, multiple sources 2024].

**Human Evaluation Limitations**
Studies have found that humans are not skilled at identifying mistakes in LLM outputs in complex tasks; therefore, models learning to generate confident-sounding yet incorrect text can lead to significant issues when deployed [RLHF risks, Chip Huyen 2023](https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html).

**Implication for Prompting**: RLHF-trained models may respond better to polite, structured prompts and may exhibit over-confidence. Prompting strategies should account for potential over-confidence in responses.

---

## 6. Context Window Size Effects

### 6.1 The Context Window Illusion

**Advertised vs. Effective Context**
Most models exhibit a U-shaped attention pattern: they heavily weight the beginning and end of the context, and largely ignore the middle, known as the "donut hole" problem [The Context Window Illusion, Medium](https://medium.com/@johnmunn/the-context-window-illusion-why-your-128k-tokens-arent-working-d224d8219bae).

**Effective Context Lengths by Model** (2024 data):
- **GPT-4o (128K advertised)**: Approximately 8K effective tokens, strong primacy and recency
- **Claude 2.1 (100K)**: Decent recency recall but mid-context failure beyond 40K
- **Gemini 1.5 (1M)**: Smoother distribution, but drops off steeply past 50K
- **LLaMA 3 (70B)**: Mid-token attention collapse beginning near 16K

**Performance Degradation**
GPT-4 Turbo's recall performance starts to degrade when handling more than 73k tokens, and the model's performance only degrades to the level of standard GPT-4 when it reaches a 64k context window [GPT-4 Turbo context window analysis, Povio](https://povio.com/blog/gpt-4-turbo-preview-exploring-the-128k-context-window).

### 6.2 Position-Dependent Prompting Strategies

**Where Content Appears Matters**
Where content appears in your prompt drastically affects performance [LLM Prompt Best Practices for Large Context Windows, Winder.AI](https://winder.ai/llm-prompt-best-practices-large-context-windows/):

- Models learn better from **few-shot examples placed near the end** than in the middle
- **Chain-of-thought step-by-step logic fragments** when placed far from the final task
- For RAG ordering, retrieving documents isn't enough—**positioning them well** is just as crucial

### 6.3 Practical Recommendations

**Optimize for 32K or Less**
The recommendation is to optimize for 32K or less. Performance increases across all models from 2k to 4k context length, and continues for many models up to 16-32k context length, but most models have a saturation point after which performance decreases:
- 16k for GPT-4-turbo and Claude-3-sonnet

**Recent Model Improvements**
However, recent models such as **GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet and GPT-4o-mini** have improved long context behavior that shows little to no performance deterioration as context length increases [Long Context RAG Performance, Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/long-context-rag-performance-llms).

### 6.4 Computational Implications

**Quadratic Scaling**
Increasing context length from 4K to 8K requires **4x the memory and computational power** due to the quadratic scaling of the self-attention mechanism [Context window computational costs].

## 7. Multimodal Models: Vision-Language Prompting

### 7.1 Architectural Differences from Text-Only

**Modality Integration**
While traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) showcased remarkable performance in Natural Language Processing tasks through innovations like instruction following, In-Context Learning (ICL), and Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, they remain limited to text-based understanding, leaving them "blind" to other modalities like visual data [Multimodal Large Language Models, Oxford Academic 2024](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/11/12/nwae403/7896414).

**Vision Language Models (VLMs)**
VLMs are a specialized category that integrate text and image inputs and generate text outputs, with the main difference being that MLLMs can work with more modalities, not only text and images as VLMs [Vision Language Models Explained, Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/vlms).

**Technical Architecture**
Multimodal models integrate a pre-trained image encoder into the language model using adapters, which connect image data to the text-processing layers, allowing the models to handle both image and text inputs simultaneously [Multimodal LLMs: Learn How MLLMs Blend Vision & Language, ProjectPro](https://www.projectpro.io/article/multimodal-llms/1054).

### 7.2 Emergent Capabilities

**Novel Abilities**
The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLMs, such as writing stories based on images and optical character recognition-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional multimodal methods [A survey on multimodal large language models, PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11645129/).

### 7.3 Prompting Challenges Specific to Multimodal Models

**High Sensitivity to Prompts**
A critical limitation is that multimodal LLMs are **highly sensitive to prompts** and often rely heavily on prompt design, which can disproportionately influence their outputs—if prompts deviate from the training data distribution, the model's ability to understand and generate accurate results declines [Visual cognition in multimodal large language models, Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00963-y).

**Text-Heavy Image Challenges**
Despite advances in visual processing, multimodal LLMs struggle with images containing dense textual information, often failing to fully capture context within text-heavy images, especially when fixed query embeddings limit the model's flexibility—particularly challenging in domains like document analysis [Vision-Language Models challenges, Encord](https://encord.com/blog/vision-language-models-guide/).

**Cognitive Domain Limitations**
Modern vision-based language models face challenges with:
- Complex physical interactions
- Causal reasoning
- Intuitive psychology

While some models exhibit proficient visual data processing capabilities, they fall short of human performance in these cognitive domains [Multimodal LLMs transforming Computer Vision, Edge AI Vision Alliance](https://www.edge-ai-vision.com/2025/01/multimodal-large-language-models-transforming-computer-vision/).

### 7.4 Prompting Best Practices for Multimodal

**Prompt Design Critical**
Given the high sensitivity to prompt structure, multimodal prompting requires:
- Clear, specific instructions about what to analyze in images
- Awareness that prompts deviating from training data distribution will fail
- Special consideration for text-heavy images (may need explicit instructions to read text)
- Understanding that visual reasoning differs from text reasoning

## 8. Model Family Differences (2024)

### 8.1 GPT Series (OpenAI)

**Characteristics**
GPT-4 is more flexible and creative, with default outputs that tend to be very neutral and sometimes appear more robotic or detached. The latest foundation model, GPT-4o, was released on May 13, 2024, with a smaller and cheaper version, GPT-4o mini, released on July 18, 2024 [GPT‑4.1 and the Frontier of AI, Walturn](https://www.walturn.com/insights/gpt-4-1-and-the-frontier-of-ai-capabilities-improvements-and-comparison-to-claude-3-gemini-mistral-and-llama).

**Best For**: Flexibility, creative tasks, technical/neutral outputs

### 8.2 Claude Series (Anthropic)

**Characteristics**
Claude is better at structure and nuance. Claude consistently produces some of the highest-quality written content, with language that feels natural and human-like - it's almost as if a person, not a machine, had written it. The latest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, was released on June 20, 2024 [A Detailed Comparison of all LLMs in 2025, Medium](https://medium.com/@aryadav.2810/a-detailed-comparison-of-all-llms-in-2025-gpt-vs-gemini-vs-deepseek-vs-llama-vs-claude-and-more-f54b576c77d4).

**Best For**: Natural language, writing, nuanced responses, structured outputs

### 8.3 Gemini Series (Google)

Llama is **free for commercial and research use** [AI Models Comparison 2025, Collabnix](https://collabnix.com/comparing-top-ai-models-in-2025-claude-grok-gpt-llama-gemini-and-deepseek-the-ultimate-guide/).

**Best For**: Open-source applications, fine-tuning, cost-sensitive deployments

### 8.5 Task-Specific Recommendations

**Coding**: O3 Mini, LLaMA 3-70B, and Gemini Pro are great choices for coding and logic

**Writing**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 are excellent for storytelling and content writing

**Speed**: Cohere's Command R+ and Gemini 2.0 Flash are two of the fastest options
