## Key Findings

### 1. Mechanistic Understanding ✓ Validated

**Chain-of-Thought Works Because**:
- Enables serial computation transformers architecturally cannot perform in parallel
- Fundamentally expands computational power to recognize all regular languages
- Multiple parallel pathways: processes both input question and generated CoT tokens
- **Caveat**: Generated reasoning may not reflect actual internal mechanisms (faithfulness issue)

**In-Context Learning Works Because**:
- **Induction heads** (two-layer attention circuits) implement pattern matching and completion
- Operates as **implicit gradient descent** with attention weights encoding optimization information
- Achieves prediction error competitive with best linear predictor over test distribution
- Can execute sophisticated algorithms (EM algorithm) through forward pass alone

- Anthropic (2022): In-context Learning and Induction Heads
- JMLR (2024): Trained Transformers Learn Linear Models In-Context
- Feng & Steinhardt (2023): The Expressive Power of Transformers with Chain of Thought

### 2. Empirical Validation ✓ Quantified

**Techniques with Strong Evidence**:

| Technique | Validated Effect | Benchmark |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|
| Self-Consistency CoT | +3.9% to +17.9% | GSM8K, SVAMP, AQuA, StrategyQA, ARC |
| Few-Shot Learning | 0% → 90% | Task-dependent (medical coding example) |
| RAG Integration | +15-18% | Domain-specific applications (MIRAGE benchmark) |
| Automatic Optimization (DSPy) | +5% to +17.8% | Task-dependent |

**Techniques Debunked**:
- **Role Prompting**: No reliable effect on correctness (2,000 MMLU questions, GPT-4-turbo)
- **System Prompts/Personas**: No effect or negative effect on factual tasks
- **Exception**: "Positive thinking" phrases show +20% in some cases (not role prompting)

**Prompt Sensitivity**:
- Performance variation up to **76 accuracy points** from formatting changes (LLaMA-2-13B)
- MMLU-Pro reduced sensitivity from 4-5% → 2% (better benchmark design)
- Adding just **one few-shot example** significantly reduces sensitivity

**Key Sources**:
- The Prompt Report (Schulhoff et al., 2024): 1,565 papers analyzed, 58 techniques catalogued
- Self-Consistency study (Wang et al., 2022): Quantified improvements across benchmarks
- Revisiting Chain-of-Thought (2025): Zero-shot often sufficient for strong recent models

### 3. Model Architecture Differences ✓ Mapped

**Reasoning Models (o1/o3, DeepSeek-R1)**:

**Critical Differences**:
- ✗ Temperature, top_p, presence_penalty, frequency_penalty, logprobs (unsupported)
- ✓ Use max_completion_tokens only
- Built-in reasoning—no need for explicit "think step by step"
- **Performance**: o3 scored 91.6% on AIME 2024 vs. o1's 74.3% (+17.3%)
- **When NOT to use**: Simple queries, casual conversation, speed-critical applications

**Model Scale Effects**:
- **7B models**: Require explicit prompting, benefit from few-shot examples
- **70B+ models**: Better zero-shot performance, more robust to variations
- **Mistral 7B**: Performs like Llama 2 3x larger (21B equivalent)

**Instruction-Tuned vs. Base**:
- Instruction-tuned: **+18% accuracy** on zero-shot tasks, better instruction following
- Base models: More diverse outputs but require explicit prompting
- Instruction-tuned risk: Mode collapse (less diversity)

**Context Window Reality**:

| Model | Advertised | Effective |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| GPT-4o | 128K | ~8K |
| Claude 2.1 | 100K | ~40K |
| Gemini 1.5 | 1M | ~50K |
| LLaMA 3 70B | Variable | ~16K |

**Exception**: GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-sonnet, GPT-4o-mini show little degradation

**Position Matters**: U-shaped attention (heavy at beginning/end, ignore middle)

**Key Sources**:
- OpenAI (2024-2025): Reasoning models API documentation
- DeepSeek-R1 paper (arXiv 2025): Pure RL approach achieving o1 parity
- Meta AI (2024): Llama 3 model comparisons

### 4. Theoretical Limits ✓ Documented

**Architectural Limits** (Cannot Be Fixed by Prompting):

1. **NC1-Hard Problems**: Cannot solve without intermediate steps (e.g., arithmetic expressions, linear equations)
2. **Continuous Functions**: Bad at approximating smooth functions (piecewise constant bias)
3. **Low-Sensitivity Bias**: Struggle with problems requiring sensitivity to many input features
4. **Compositional Generalization**: Cannot generalize to patterns beyond training data

**Reasoning Limits**:

1. **Memorization vs. Reasoning**: Open question—perform better on familiar vs. counterfactual scenarios
2. **Complexity Collapse**: Even reasoning models (o3) face complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexity
3. **Statistical Pattern Dependence**: Higher accuracy when correct answer is high-probability sequence
4. **Specific Failures**:
   - Mathematical reasoning: Lack rules-based counting system
   - Spatial reasoning: Lack fundamental spatial awareness
   - Goal drift: Sequential tasks become less reliable over time

**Hallucination Limits**:

- **Baseline**: 3-16% hallucination rate for public LLMs
- **Prompt-based mitigation**: 53% → 23% reduction (GPT-4o) but cannot eliminate
- **Root cause**: Next-token training rewards confident guessing over calibrated uncertainty
- **Structural issue**: Language generation, not logical reasoning

**Security Vulnerabilities** (Fundamental, Not Fixable):

| Model | Attack Success Rate |
|-------|-------------------|
| GPT-4 | 87.2% |
| Claude 2 | 82.5% |
| Mistral 7B | 71.3% |
| Vicuna | 69.4% |

- **Prompt injection**: #1 security vulnerability (OWASP Top 10)
- **No fool-proof prevention** exists (stochastic nature of models)
- **Emerging threats**: Multimodal attacks (hiding instructions in images)

**When Fine-Tuning Is Necessary**:
- Domain-specific accuracy requirements
- Production scale (100K+ inferences—lower per-inference cost)
- Hallucination rate <2% needed
- Security-critical applications
- Deterministic, reproducible behavior required

- TACL (2024): What Formal Languages Can Transformers Express?
- MIT News (2024): Reasoning skills often overestimated
- arXiv (2024): Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques

## Actionable Insights for Framework Development

### 1. Evidence-Based Technique Selection

**Implement (Strong Evidence)**:
✓ Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency (+3.9% to +17.9%)
✓ Few-shot learning (0% to 90% on appropriate tasks)
✓ RAG integration (+15-18% domain-specific)
✓ Decomposition and self-criticism
✓ Zero-shot CoT for strong recent models

**Skip (Debunked)**:
✗ Role prompting for correctness tasks
✗ Complex system prompts/personas for factual tasks
✗ Reliance on single "magic prompt" (up to 76 point sensitivity)

### 2. Architecture-Aware Adaptation

**Reasoning Models (o1/o3/R1)**:
- No temperature/sampling parameters
- No explicit CoT prompts (built-in)
- Use for: Math, coding, complex reasoning
- Avoid for: Simple queries, speed-critical tasks

**Standard Models**:
- 7B: Explicit prompting + few-shot examples
- 70B+: Zero-shot often sufficient
- Instruction-tuned: Better at complex multi-step instructions
- Base: More diverse, need explicit prompting

**Context Window Strategy**:
- Optimize for 32K or less for most models
- Place critical info at beginning or end (U-shaped attention)
- Effective context << advertised context

### 3. Limit-Aware Escalation

**Escalate to Fine-Tuning When**:
- Domain-specific accuracy critical
- Production scale (100K+ inferences)
- Hallucination rate <2% required
- Security-critical (no prompt injection tolerance)
- Deterministic behavior needed

**Escalate to External Tools When**:
- Rules-based mathematical operations
- Spatial navigation/embodied reasoning
- Continuous function approximation
- Novel compositional patterns beyond training

**Recognize Unfixable Limits**:
- Prompt injection (70-87% attack success rates)
- Complete hallucination elimination (3-16% baseline)
- Memorization vs. reasoning distinction
- True spatial awareness

### 4. Security-Conscious Design

**Assume Compromise**:
- Prompt injection is fundamental—cannot be fully prevented
- Design systems assuming prompts will be injected
- Implement defense-in-depth (input validation, output validation, separation of concerns)
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

**Specific Mitigations**:
- Input validation (partial defense)
- Output validation against expected behavior
- Filter `<think>` tags for DeepSeek-R1 in production
- Adversarial training (improves robustness, doesn't eliminate)

### 5. Validation Protocol

**Testing Requirements**:
- **Multi-prompt evaluation**: Test 3-5 paraphrases
- **Statistical rigor**: 100 repetitions per condition (Wharton standard)
- **Cross-model validation**: Test on ≥2 different models
- **Failure mode analysis**: Identify systematic errors
- **Benchmark comparison**: Zero-shot, simple CoT, few-shot, fine-tuned baselines

**Expected Variation**:
- MMLU-Pro: 2% variation (good benchmark)
- Standard prompts: 4-5% variation
- >5% variation: Prompt is brittle, needs refinement
