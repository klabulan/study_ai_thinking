### Future Perspectives

**70. The Future of Prompt Engineering: Evolution or Extinction? (Medium)**
- URL: https://medium.com/code-and-theory/the-future-of-prompt-engineering-evolution-or-extinction-2a74f183fae1
- **Key Finding**: Transformation into specialized niche skill rather than extinction
- **Relevance**: Realistic trajectory assessment
- **Methodology**: Trend analysis
- **Quality**: High—thoughtful perspective

### Relevance for Prompting Framework

**Theoretical limits enable**:
- Knowing when prompting cannot work (NC1-hard problems, continuous functions)
- Escalation criteria for fine-tuning (domain accuracy, production scale)
- Security-aware design (assuming prompt injection succeeds)
- Realistic hallucination expectations (3-16% baseline, reducible not eliminable)
- Hybrid approach design (prompting + fine-tuning + external tools)
