## Key Findings at a Glance

### Mechanistic Understanding ✓ Validated

**Chain-of-Thought**:
- Enables serial computation transformers architecturally cannot perform
- Fundamentally expands computational power
- **Caveat**: Generated reasoning may not reflect actual internal mechanisms

**In-Context Learning**:
- Induction heads (two-layer attention circuits) implement pattern matching
- Operates as implicit gradient descent with attention weights encoding optimization
- Can execute sophisticated algorithms (EM algorithm) through forward pass

### Empirical Validation ✓ Quantified

| Technique | Evidence | Effect |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Self-Consistency CoT | ✓ Strong | +3.9% to +17.9% |
| Few-Shot Learning | ✓ Strong | 0% → 90% (task-dependent) |
| RAG Integration | ✓ Validated | +15-18% (domain-specific) |
| Role Prompting | ✗ Debunked | No reliable effect on correctness |
| System Prompts | ✗ Ineffective | No effect or negative |

### Architecture Differences ✓ Mapped

**Reasoning Models (o1/o3/R1)**:
- ✗ Temperature, top_p, sampling parameters (unsupported)
- ✓ Built-in reasoning—no explicit CoT needed
- Performance: o3 scored 91.6% vs. o1's 74.3% on AIME 2024

**Context Windows**:
| Model | Advertised | Effective |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| GPT-4o | 128K | ~8K |
| Claude 2.1 | 100K | ~40K |
| Gemini 1.5 | 1M | ~50K |

### Theoretical Limits ✓ Documented

**Architectural Limits** (Cannot Fix with Prompting):
- NC1-hard problems require intermediate steps
- Cannot approximate continuous functions reliably
- Cannot generalize to compositional patterns beyond training
- Cannot eliminate hallucinations (3-16% baseline)
- Cannot prevent prompt injection (70-87% attack success rates)

**When Fine-Tuning Necessary**:
- Domain-specific accuracy requirements
- Production scale (100K+ inferences)
- Hallucination rate <2% needed
- Security-critical applications
- Deterministic behavior required

## Critical Insights for Framework

### Evidence-Based Technique Selection

**Implement** (Strong Evidence):
- Chain-of-Thought with self-consistency
- Few-shot learning (even one example reduces sensitivity)
- RAG for domain-specific applications
- Decomposition and self-criticism

**Skip** (Debunked):
- Role prompting for correctness tasks
- Complex system prompts/personas for factual tasks
- Reliance on single "magic prompt"

### Architecture-Aware Adaptation

**Reasoning Models** (o1/o3/R1):
- No temperature/sampling parameters
- No explicit CoT prompts
- Use for: Math, coding, complex reasoning
- Avoid for: Simple queries, speed-critical

**Standard Models**:
- 7B: Explicit prompting + few-shot
- 70B+: Zero-shot often sufficient
- Adapt to instruction-tuned vs. base

### Limit-Aware Escalation

**Escalate to Fine-Tuning**:
- Domain-specific accuracy critical
- Production scale (100K+ inferences)
- Hallucination rate <2% required
- Security-critical applications

**Escalate to External Tools**:
- Rules-based mathematical operations
- Spatial reasoning
- Continuous function approximation

**Acknowledge Unfixable**:
- Prompt injection (70-87% success rates)
- Complete hallucination elimination
- Memorization vs. reasoning distinction

### Security-Conscious Design

**Assume Compromise**:
- Prompt injection is fundamental
- Design systems assuming prompts will be injected
- Implement defense-in-depth
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
