## 1. Fundamental Theoretical Limits of Transformers

### 1.1 Function Approximation Limitations

**Continuous Function Struggles**
Research from 2024 reveals that Transformers struggle to reliably approximate continuous/smooth functions, relying on piecewise constant approximations with sizable intervals. While Transformers are quite adept at approximating piecewise constant functions with moderately large-sized pieces, they are bad at approximating continuous functions [Transformers are Expressive, But Are They Expressive Enough for Regression? 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.15478v1).

**Implication for Prompting**: Tasks requiring smooth, continuous numerical predictions may be fundamentally limited regardless of prompt quality.

### 1.2 Sensitivity and Learning Biases

**Low-Sensitivity Bias**
Empirical studies have identified persistent difficulties in learning simple formal languages such as PARITY, and a bias towards low-degree functions. Under the transformer architecture, the loss landscape is constrained by input-space sensitivity: Transformers whose output is sensitive to many parts of the input string inhabit isolated points in parameter space, leading to a **low-sensitivity bias in generalization** [Why are Sensitive Functions Hard for Transformers? 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09963).

**Practical Impact**: Problems requiring sensitivity to many input features simultaneously may be inherently difficult for transformers, limiting what prompting can achieve.

### 1.3 Formal Language Limitations

**NC1-Hardness Boundary**
Researchers have investigated theoretically what problems transformers can and cannot solve by treating problems as formal languages. Problems like evaluating arithmetic expressions or solving linear equations are **NC1-hard and cannot be solved by precision transformer decoders without intermediate steps** [What Formal Languages Can Transformers Express? A Survey, TACL 2024](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00663/120983/What-Formal-Languages-Can-Transformers-Express-A).

**Key Insight**: Chain-of-thought prompting is not just helpful but **necessary** for certain problem classes—transformers fundamentally cannot solve them in a single forward pass.

### 1.4 Compositional Reasoning Failures

**Systematic Composition Problems**
Transformer-based systems appear to have problems with composition involving:
- Spatial information
- Temporal composition
- Relationship information

[Representational Strengths and Limitations of Transformers, 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=36DxONZ9bA)

**Common-Sense Reasoning Gap**
Transformers often struggle with common-sense reasoning, as they primarily rely on patterns learned from data rather than true understanding [Limitations of Transformer Architecture, Medium](https://medium.com/@thirupathi.thangavel/limitations-of-transformer-architecture-4e6118cbf5a4).

---

## 2. Compositional Generalization: Systematic Failures

### 2.1 Beyond Training Distribution

**Systematic Generalization Challenge**
Recent research shows that state-of-the-art transformer architectures and LLMs still **lack systematic and compositional generalization skills**. LLMs perform well when test data resembles training examples but fail to generalize to patterns beyond their observed data [Exploring Compositional Generalization of Large Language Models, NAACL 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-srw.3/).

**Critical Finding**: No amount of prompt engineering can enable generalization to compositional patterns that weren't present in training data.

### 2.2 Skills-in-Context Prompting: Partial Solution

**Grounding Reasoning Steps**
Research examined how to elicit compositional generalization abilities in LLMs, finding that it's crucial to **explicitly ground each reasoning step on foundational skills**. This prompt structure called "skills-in-context" (SKiC) demonstrates strong (near-perfect) systematic generalization abilities across many tasks [Skills-in-Context Prompting: Unlocking Compositionality in Large Language Models, 2023](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372827564_Skills-in-Context_Prompting_Unlocking_Compositionality_in_Large_Language_Models).

**Limitation**: Requires knowing which foundational skills to explicitly specify—doesn't work for truly novel compositional patterns.

### 2.3 Complexity Limits

**Chain-of-Thought Struggles**
Chain-of-thought prompting tends to struggle when generalizing to solve problems that are **more complex than the examples provided in the prompts**, leading to alternative approaches for compositional reasoning [How Can Least-to-Most Prompting Enable Complex Reasoning in LLMs? Medium](https://medium.com/@marketing_novita.ai/how-can-least-to-most-prompting-enable-complex-reasoning-in-llms-7580211273d8).

### 2.4 Compositional Instruction Hierarchy

**Asymmetric Transfer**
Experimental results from 2024 indicate that training LLMs on **higher-order compositional instructions enhances their performance on lower-order ones, but the reverse does not hold true** [Exploring Compositional Generalization research, 2024].

**Implication**: Cannot use simpler prompts to build up to complex compositional tasks—must start with appropriate complexity level.

---

## 3. Reasoning Limitations: What Remains Unsolved

### 3.1 Memorization vs. True Reasoning

**Fundamental Uncertainty**
It remains an open question how to train models to focus more on reasoning rather than memorization. The community remains puzzled about whether these models genuinely generalize to unseen tasks, or seemingly succeed by memorizing the training data [Climbing the Ladder of Reasoning, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11741v1).

**Performance on Counterfactual Tasks**
Despite LLMs performing better than random in counterfactual settings, their performance is consistently behind that in the default settings. LLMs excel in familiar scenarios but struggle in novel ones, questioning their true reasoning abilities versus reliance on memorization [Reasoning skills of large language models are often overestimated, MIT News 2024](https://news.mit.edu/2024/reasoning-skills-large-language-models-often-overestimated-0711).

### 3.2 Complexity Collapse in Reasoning Models

**Frontier LRM Limitations**
Frontier LRMs (Large Reasoning Models like o3) face a **complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities** and exhibit a counter-intuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having an adequate token budget [The Illusion of Thinking, Apple Machine Learning Research, 2024](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking).

**Critical Finding**: Even advanced reasoning models have hard limits on problem complexity—cannot be overcome with better prompting.

### 3.3 Statistical Pattern Dependence

**Training Distribution Constraint**
The model's reasoning process remains heavily influenced by the statistical patterns learned during training. Models achieve higher accuracy when the correct answer is a high-probability sequence, and performance improves markedly on tasks that appear frequently in training data [Understanding LLMs' Reasoning Limits, Medium](https://medium.com/@parserdigital/understanding-llms-reasoning-limits-today-insights-to-shape-your-future-strategy-fc1c27c9e904).

**Implication**: Prompting cannot make models reliably solve problems whose solution patterns are rare in training data.

### 3.4 Architectural Reasoning Constraints

**Autoregressive Limitations**
The autoregressive nature of LLMs might not be the optimal way to approach complex reasoning. LLMs can't stop, gather world state, reason, revisit older answers or predict future answers, unless that process also is detailed in the training data [What can LLMs never do? Strange Loop Canon](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/what-can-llms-never-do).

### 3.5 Specific Unsolvable Problem Classes

**Mathematical Reasoning**
LLMs express fragility in conducting simple mathematical reasoning, and while they can often provide correct answers to sophisticated mathematical queries, they **fundamentally lack a rules-based counting system** [Why Large Language Models Struggle with Mathematical Reasoning, Medium](https://medium.com/@adnanmasood/why-large-language-models-struggle-with-mathematical-reasoning-3dc8e9f964ae).

**Spatial and Embodied Reasoning**
LLMs lack fundamental spatial awareness, so explaining the steps needed to navigate from one point to another in physical space or understanding the spatial configuration of objects remains a complex challenge [LLM Reasoning Guide, Kili Technology 2025](https://kili-technology.com/large-language-models-llms/llm-reasoning-guide).

**Goal Drift in Sequential Tasks**
There is inevitably a form of 'goal drift' where inference gets less reliable, meaning that agents, or tasks done in a sequence with iteration, get less reliable [LLM limitations research, 2024].

**Novel Problem Solving**
Large Language Models often struggle to answer questions that adult humans find straightforward, and **present training methods do not sufficiently equip LLMs for tasks requiring novel forms of reasoning** [Easy Problems That LLMs Get Wrong, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19616v2).

---

## 4. Hallucination: Fundamental Limits of Mitigation

### 4.1 Current Hallucination Rates

**Baseline Performance**
As of January 2024, hallucination rates for publicly available LLMs range from approximately **3% to 16%** [A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01313).

### 4.2 Limits of Prompt-Based Mitigation

**Weak Generalization**
Prompt techniques have **weak generalization ability**, and multiple iterations are required to fine-tune the prompts in practical applications, which may be very time-consuming [Hallucination Mitigation for RAG LLMs, MDPI 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/13/5/856).

**Diagnostic vs. Solution**
These solutions underscore how far we still have to go to build genuinely trustworthy intelligence, and using prompting is arguably more **a diagnostic tool to surface the model's capability gaps needing intervention rather than a complete solution** to AI safety alone [Advanced Prompt Engineering for Reducing Hallucination, Medium](https://medium.com/@bijit211987/advanced-prompt-engineering-for-reducing-hallucination-bb2c8ce62fc6).

### 4.3 Recent Empirical Limits (2025)

**Partial Improvement Only**
A 2025 multi-model analysis in npj Digital Medicine shows that simple prompt-based mitigation cut GPT-4o's hallucination rate from 53% to 23%, while temperature tweaks alone barely helped. However, **more data or cleverer prompts won't fix hallucinations while the underlying incentives stay the same** [LLM Hallucinations in 2025, Lakera](https://www.lakera.ai/blog/guide-to-hallucinations-in-large-language-models).

**Training Objective Problem**
OpenAI's September 2025 paper shows that next-token training objectives and common leaderboards reward confident guessing over calibrated uncertainty, so **models learn to bluff** [Theoretical Foundations and Mitigation of Hallucination, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.22915v1).

### 4.4 Persistent Structural Challenges

**Dataset and Domain Complexity**
Challenges remain due to dataset reliability, language domain complexity, and requiring a unified solution across tasks [A Comprehensive Survey of Hallucination Mitigation Techniques, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01313).

**Logical Reasoning Foundation**
The reasoning process of LLMs is based on **language generation rather than logical reasoning**, lacking an understanding of logical rules and causal relationships. Prompt methods such as chain-of-thought encourage LLMs to decompose the problem, but when solving the problem, **even if correctly decomposed, LLMs often make mistakes in logic and arithmetic** [Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models, ACM TOIS 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3703155).

**Key Conclusion**: Prompting can reduce but not eliminate hallucinations—fundamental architectural and training changes are needed.

## 5. Security: Prompt Injection and Jailbreaking

### 5.1 Vulnerability Landscape (2024-2025)

**High Attack Success Rates**
Recent systematic evaluations show concerning vulnerability levels [Red Teaming the Mind of the Machine, 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.04806v1):
- **GPT-4**: 87.2% attack success rate (ASR)
- **Claude 2**: 82.5% ASR
- **Mistral 7B**: 71.3% ASR (open models)
- **Vicuna**: 69.4% ASR

These results reveal significant weaknesses, likely due to the absence of robust fine-tuned safety layers in some models.

### 5.2 Attack Type Distinctions

**Prompt Injection vs. Jailbreaking**
While prompt injection and jailbreaking are often used interchangeably:
- **Prompt injection**: Manipulating model responses through specific inputs to alter behavior
- **Jailbreaking**: A form of prompt injection where the attacker provides inputs that cause the model to **disregard its safety protocols entirely**

[Prompt injection and jailbreaking are not the same thing, Simon Willison 2024](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Mar/5/prompt-injection-jailbreaking/)

### 5.3 Emerging Multimodal Threats

**Cross-Modality Attacks**
The rise of multimodal AI introduces unique prompt injection risks, as malicious actors could **exploit interactions between modalities, such as hiding instructions in images that accompany benign text** [Prompt Injection Attacks on LLMs, HiddenLayer](https://hiddenlayer.com/innovation-hub/prompt-injection-attacks-on-llms/).

### 5.4 Defense Limitations

**No Fool-Proof Prevention**
Given the stochastic influence at the heart of the way models work, it is **unclear if there are fool-proof methods of prevention** for prompt injection [What Is a Prompt Injection Attack? IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection).

**Advanced Evasion Techniques**
Character injection methods like **emoji smuggling and bidirectional text** enable near-complete evasion of some guardrails, while adversarial machine learning techniques demonstrate effective, imperceptible evasion by exploiting training blind spots [Bypassing Prompt Injection and Jailbreak Detection, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11168v1).

### 5.5 Defense Developments

**Adversarial Training Approach**
Research shows that supplementing a classifier with an adversarially generated training set of "noisy" jailbreaking attempts significantly improves its robustness [GitHub: prompt-injection-defenses](https://github.com/tldrsec/prompt-injection-defenses).

**JailGuard Framework**
New detection frameworks like JailGuard operate on the principle that **attacks are inherently less robust than benign ones**, leveraging discrepancies in response variants to distinguish attack samples [Prompt Hacking in LLMs 2024-2025 Literature Review](https://www.rohan-paul.com/p/prompt-hacking-in-llms-2024-2025).

### 5.6 Fundamental Problem

**OWASP Top Security Issue**
The research consistently indicates that **prompt injections are the number one security vulnerability** on the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications, and there is growing consensus that prompt injection is **not an edge-case anomaly but a fundamental issue** in current-generation LLMs [LLM01:2025 Prompt Injection, OWASP](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm01-prompt-injection/).

---

## 6. In-Context Learning Limitations

### 6.1 Context Size Constraints

**Maximum Context Limitation**
In-context learning faces constraints from the model's maximum context size, which can **limit the amount of information that can be provided at inference time** [Pre-training vs Fine-Tuning vs In-Context Learning, Entry Point AI](https://www.entrypointai.com/blog/pre-training-vs-fine-tuning-vs-in-context-learning-of-large-language-models/).

### 6.2 Cost and Efficiency

**Inference Cost Problem**
ICL is limited by context length restrictions and **incurs higher costs during each inference stage** due to the longer prompts required. This makes it less efficient for production environments with high inference volumes [Key AI Methodologies: Fine-Tuning vs. In-Context Learning](https://ai-pro.org/learn-ai/articles/optimal-strategies-for-ai-performance-fine-tune-vs-incontext-learning).

### 6.3 Prompt Quality Sensitivity

**Brittleness to Formulation**
Poorly defined prompts may lead to misinterpretation or irrelevant responses, making the approach **sensitive to prompt quality** [Fine-Tuning vs. In-Context Learning: A Practical Guide, Medium](https://medium.com/@heyamit10/fine-tuning-vs-in-context-learning-a-practical-guide-08163ede6d1a).

### 6.4 Lack of Persistent Learning

**No Session Memory**
In-context learning **does not build upon previous interactions over time**, which may hinder performance on recurring tasks, lacking the ability to learn persistently from experience [ICL limitations, multiple sources 2024].

### 6.5 Counterintuitive Finding: Implicit Pattern Advantage

**When ICL Outperforms Fine-Tuning**
For tasks with **implicit patterns, ICL captures these patterns significantly better than fine-tuning**, presenting a counterintuitive finding from October 2024 research that challenges conventional wisdom about when each approach excels [Deeper Insights Without Updates: The Power of In-Context Learning Over Fine-Tuning, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04691).

---

## 7. When Fine-Tuning Becomes Necessary

### 7.1 Decision Framework

**Resource Trade-offs**
- **Prompt engineering**: No new data or computing resources, relies solely on human input, faster and cheaper
- **Fine-tuning**: Requires significant compute and additional high-quality datasets, alters the model itself

[RAG vs fine-tuning vs. prompt engineering, IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/rag-vs-fine-tuning-vs-prompt-engineering)

### 7.2 Use Prompt Engineering When:

1. **Immediate improvements needed** and high adaptability required
2. **Limited computational or financial resources**
3. **Exploring or prototyping** - quick iteration needed
4. **One-off tasks** or frequently changing requirements
5. **Access to model parameters is limited**
6. **Users can write effective prompts** confidently

[When to use prompt engineering vs. fine-tuning, TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/Prompt-engineering-vs-fine-tuning-Whats-the-difference)

### 7.3 Use Fine-Tuning When:

1. **Domain-specific accuracy** is critical and non-negotiable
2. **Production deployment** with high inference volumes
3. **Precise, lasting performance improvements** needed
4. **Willing to invest** in infrastructure, time, and technical expertise
5. **Substantial labeled data** available for target domain
6. **Computational efficiency** required (fewer tokens per inference)

[PromptHub Blog: Fine-Tuning vs Prompt Engineering](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/fine-tuning-vs-prompt-engineering)

### 7.4 Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Training vs. Inference**
The fine-tuned model typically requires **fewer resources for inference** because it can use fewer tokens or leverage a lighter model with fewer parameters. This is important because **training is a one-time event whereas inference requires ongoing costs** [Few-shot Fine-tuning vs. In-context Learning, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16938).

### 7.5 Hybrid Approach

**Combining Both Methods**
The three methods (prompting, fine-tuning, RAG) are **not mutually exclusive and are often combined** for optimal outcomes. Many teams use prompt engineering as a precursor to fine-tuning. For example, you may first develop a high-performing prompt for customer service chatbots, then fine-tune a model on thousands of examples that follow this pattern to scale the experience. This hybrid strategy maximizes both flexibility and consistency [Prompt Engineering vs Fine-tuning vs RAG, Medium](https://medium.com/@myscale/prompt-engineering-vs-finetuning-vs-rag-cfae761c6d06).

---

## 8. Practical Limits and Future Trajectory

### 8.1 Current State Assessment

**Not Perfect, Still Valuable**
While AI advancements suggest a declining role for prompt engineering, AI systems are not perfect and still benefit from well-crafted prompts, particularly in **edge cases, specialized domains or when creative precision is necessary** [The Future of Prompt Engineering: Evolution or Extinction? Medium](https://medium.com/code-and-theory/the-future-of-prompt-engineering-evolution-or-extinction-2a74f183fae1).

**Specialization Remains Valuable**
For applications like legal documents, scientific research or highly creative outputs, the ability to design sophisticated prompts remains valuable, as these cases often demand a **level of specificity that current AI cannot always autonomously infer** [Prompt Engineering: Techniques, Limits, and Future Perspectives, Scribble Data](https://www.scribbledata.io/blog/prompt-engineering-introduction-techniques-limits-and-future-perspective/).

### 8.2 Future Trajectory

**Transformation vs. Extinction**
Prompt engineering may not entirely vanish but rather **transform into a specialized, niche skill** for those who need highly refined outputs, with its future being one of transition rather than extinction [Prompt Engineering limitations, LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/prompt-engineering-limitations-large-language).

**Programming Still Essential**
Prompt engineering is shaping the future of software development, but its long-term role may be limited as AI improves, with **traditional programming remaining essential for high-performance systems** [Prompt Engineering: Challenges and Software Development's Future, InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/articles/prompt-engineering/).

### 8.3 Structural Constraints

**Fundamental Difference from Programming**
While programming relies on formalized syntax, deterministic execution, and precision to ensure consistency and reliability, prompt engineering leverages the adaptability of natural language [Prompt Engineering as a new 21st century skill, Frontiers in Education 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/education/articles/10.3389/feduc.2024.1366434/full).

**Implication**: Prompting will never achieve the same level of determinism and reliability as traditional programming—different tool for different purposes.
