## 1. Fundamental Prompting Patterns

### 1.1 Zero-Shot Prompting

**Definition**: Providing no examples and letting the model figure things out on its own, relying solely on the model's pre-training data and training techniques [Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot - Shelf](https://shelf.io/blog/zero-shot-and-few-shot-prompting/).

**When to Use**:
- Tasks well within the scope of model's training
- Modern reasoning models (o1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- When you want to avoid biasing the model toward surface patterns

**Performance Characteristics**:
The model's ability to handle task specificity is purely based on its **pre-trained knowledge**, which can be effective for tasks well within the scope of the model's training but might be less so for highly specialized or nuanced tasks [Vellum AI Guide](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/zero-shot-vs-few-shot-prompting-a-guide-with-examples).

**Important Caveat for Reasoning Models**: Recent research reveals that **zero-shot CoT** ("Let's think step by step") **often outperforms few-shot** for reasoning-heavy tasks because the model can directly generate a logical path without being constrained by potentially unrepresentative examples [Portkey AI](https://portkey.ai/blog/zero-shot-vs-few-shot-prompting).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Clear instruction formulation
- Task specification without examples
- Output format definition
- Reasoning elicitation techniques

---

### 1.2 Few-Shot Prompting

**Definition**: Provides the model with a few examples of the desired task, allowing the model to "see" instances of the task being performed and enabling it to tailor responses more closely to task requirements [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot).

**Performance Evidence**: Research on sentiment classification showed that **few-shot beats zero-shot by a notable margin of 10% on accuracy and 7% on F1 score** [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/few_shot).

**Key Principle**: The more examples (or shots) provided, the better the model typically performs, as it can **learn from these examples and generalize** them to new, similar tasks [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/zero-shot-vs-one-shot-vs-few-shot-learning/).

**Comparison to Fine-Tuning**: Few-shot is a promising alternative to fine-tuning, achieving **similar or better performance** across classification, language understanding, translation, and question-answering tasks [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/09/power-of-llms-zero-shot-and-few-shot-prompting/).

**Critical Limitation**: Studies and community reports show that **few-shot examples can sometimes hurt performance** by biasing the model toward surface patterns rather than allowing it to fully reason through the problem [Portkey AI](https://portkey.ai/blog/zero-shot-vs-few-shot-prompting). Few-shot prompting **consistently degrades performance** for certain reasoning models, with recommendations to directly describe the problem and specify output format using a zero-shot setting for optimal results.

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Example selection strategies
- Example diversity considerations
- Format consistency across examples
- When to avoid few-shot (reasoning models)
- Optimal number of examples (typically 2-5)

---

### 1.3 One-Shot Prompting

**Definition**: Middle ground between zero-shot and few-shot, providing **exactly one example** to demonstrate desired behavior [PrajnaAI Medium](https://prajnaaiwisdom.medium.com/zero-shot-one-shot-and-few-shot-prompting-a-comparative-guide-ac38edd510d3).

**When to Use**:
- Token efficiency is critical
- Task is straightforward but benefits from format demonstration

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Strategic example selection
- Format clarity in single example
- Trade-offs vs zero-shot and few-shot

---

## 2. Advanced Reasoning Techniques

### 2.1 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Definition**: CoT prompting involves the model generating a **sequential series of reasoning steps**, where each step builds on the previous one, helping the model tackle more complex tasks through step-by-step reasoning [Learn Prompting CoT Guide](https://learnprompting.org/blog/guide-to-chain-of-thought-part-one).

**Key Innovation**: Enhances reasoning abilities of large language models by **breaking down complex tasks into simpler sub-steps**, instructing LLMs to solve problems step-by-step [Medium - Sulbha Jain](https://medium.com/@sulbha.jindal/advanced-prompt-engineering-self-consistency-tree-of-thoughts-rag-17a2d2c8fb79).

**Improvement Strategy**: **Audit failures** in your particular examples and evals, and address systematic planning and reasoning errors with more explicit instructions [OpenAI GPT-4.1 Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide).

**Limitations**: Assumes that the reasoning process should follow a **linear pattern** that progresses from one thought to the next [Medium - Joyce Birkins](https://medium.com/@joycebirkins/x-of-thought-3-variants-of-the-s-chain-of-thoughts-cot-tot-got-lot-11a529d09dc1).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Step-by-step reasoning elicitation
- Prompting phrases ("Let's think step by step")
- Failure analysis and refinement
- When linear reasoning is appropriate

---

### 2.2 Tree of Thoughts (ToT)

**Definition**: ToT builds on CoT by enabling the model to generate **multiple branches after each reasoning step**, allowing for evaluation and selection among these branches, forming a "tree-like" structure where each step can lead to multiple possible next steps [Medium - Joyce Birkins](https://medium.com/@joycebirkins/x-of-thought-3-variants-of-the-s-chain-of-thoughts-cot-tot-got-lot-11a529d09dc1).

**Key Capability**: By exploring these branches, the model can **backtrack** (if needed), pruning less promising paths to return to a previous step for further exploration [Medium - Joyce Birkins](https://medium.com/@joycebirkins/x-of-thought-3-variants-of-the-s-chain-of-thoughts-cot-tot-got-lot-11a529d09dc1).

**When to Use**:
- Multiple solution paths exist
- Exploration and backtracking beneficial
- Complex problem-solving requiring evaluation of alternatives

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Branch generation strategies
- Evaluation criteria for path selection
- Backtracking mechanisms
- When to prune paths

---

### 2.3 Graph of Thoughts (GoT)

**Definition**: GoT advances prompting capabilities beyond CoT or ToT, with the key idea being the ability to model information generated by an LLM as an **arbitrary graph**, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices, and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices [AAAI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1609/aaai.v38i16.29720).

**Performance**: GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different tasks, for example **increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT**, while simultaneously **reducing costs by >31%** [Cameron Wolfe Substack](https://cameronrwolfe.substack.com/p/graph-based-prompting-and-reasoning).

**Recent Innovation**: **Adaptive Graph of Thoughts (AGoT)** is a dynamic, graph-based inference framework that enhances LLM reasoning solely at test time, achieving **significant performance gains (+46.2% on GPQA)** through dynamic decomposition of complex queries into structured subproblems [arXiv:2502.05078](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.05078).

**When to Use**:
- Complex dependencies between reasoning steps
- Non-linear problem structures
- Need for maximum reasoning performance

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Graph construction principles
- Dependency modeling
- Vertex and edge relationships
- Cost-performance trade-offs

---

### 2.4 Self-Consistency Prompting

**Definition**: Self-consistency samples **multiple, diverse reasoning paths** through few-shot Chain-of-Thought, and uses the generations to select the **most consistent answer** [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/consistency).

**How It Works**: First samples a diverse set of reasoning paths instead of only taking the greedy one, and then selects the most consistent answer by **marginalizing out the sampled reasoning paths**, leveraging the intuition that a complex reasoning problem typically admits multiple different ways of thinking leading to its unique correct answer [Learn Prompting](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/self_consistency).

**Performance Impact**: Self-consistency has been shown to **improve results on arithmetic, commonsense and symbolic reasoning** tasks [arXiv:2203.11171](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11171).

**Key Relationship**: It is a follow-up to Chain-of-Thought Prompting, and is **more powerful when used in conjunction with it** [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/consistency).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Multiple path generation strategies
- Consistency evaluation methods
- Voting/selection mechanisms
- Cost considerations (multiple generations)

---

### 2.5 Meta-Prompting

**Definition**: Meta prompting focuses on the **structural and syntactical aspects of tasks and problems** rather than their specific content details [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/meta-prompting).

**Key Characteristics**:
- **Structure-oriented**: Prioritizes the format and pattern of problems and solutions over specific content
- **Syntax-focused**: Uses syntax as a guiding template for the expected response or solution
- **Abstract examples**: Employs abstracted examples as frameworks, illustrating the structure without focusing on specific details [K2View Blog](https://www.k2view.com/blog/prompt-engineering-techniques/)

**Advantages**:
- **Token efficiency** by reducing the number of tokens required
- Provides a more fair approach for comparing different problem-solving models
- Functions as a form of **zero-shot prompting** where the influence of specific examples is minimized [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/meta-prompting)

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Abstract pattern formulation
- Structural template design
- Syntax-based guidance
- When to use meta vs. concrete prompting

---

## 3. Tool Use and Function Calling

### 3.1 Function Calling Fundamentals

**Definition**: Function calling is the ability to reliably connect LLMs to external tools to enable **effective tool usage and interaction with external APIs** [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/function_calling).

**How It Works**: Function calling allows LLMs to construct calls to external systems, though **the LLM does not execute these calls directly**—instead it creates a data structure that describes the call, passing that to a separate program for execution [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/function-call-LLM.html).

**Key Advantage**: Tool calling leverages an idiom that the language model **inherently understands** for invoking external actions, meaning you don't have to explain functions and JSON structures in the prompt itself [PromptLayer Blog](https://blog.promptlayer.com/tool-calling-with-llms-how-and-when-to-use-it/).

**Scalability**: This is arguably the **most scalable approach** to building complex LLM systems using **modular prompts with singular responsibilities**, and it's harder for users to "jailbreak" a model when you have strict schema definitions [Medium - PromptLayer](https://medium.com/promptlayer/tool-calling-with-llms-how-and-when-to-use-it-d65493a87954).

---

### 3.2 Effective Tool Design

**Best Practices** from Anthropic: Effective tools are **intentionally and clearly defined**, use agent context judiciously, can be **combined together in diverse workflows**, and enable agents to intuitively solve real-world tasks [Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/writing-tools-for-agents).

**Tool Descriptions**: Enhancing system prompts and descriptions had **negligible effects on overall tool correctness** and task completion, but did have **positive impact on complex test cases** that needed multiple tools and chaining [Paragon Learn](https://www.useparagon.com/learn/rag-best-practices-optimizing-tool-calling/).

**Model Selection**: Based on results, the **most significant impact on metrics came from LLM choice**, and tool calling performance will only improve as models become better, with **consistent testing processes** being the most future-proof solution [Paragon Learn](https://www.useparagon.com/learn/rag-best-practices-optimizing-tool-calling/).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Tool description best practices
- Schema definition strategies
- Error handling and fallbacks
- Multi-tool composition
- Evaluation and testing approaches

**Function Calling**: Provides a **controlled way to interact with external systems** for specific actions—excels at well-defined tasks involving specific actions and data retrieval [PromptLayer Blog](https://blog.promptlayer.com/llm-agents-vs-function-calling/).

**Agent Architecture**: LLM agents involve LLM applications that can execute complex tasks through an architecture that combines LLMs with key modules like **planning and memory**, where an LLM serves as the main controller or "brain" that controls a flow of operations [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/llm-agents).

**Agent Components**:
- **Prompt Template**: Entails important details about how the agent will operate, and the tools it will have access to (along with tool details)
- **Planning Module**: Helps to break down the necessary steps or subtasks the agent will solve individually to answer the user request, which is important to enable the agent to **reason better about the problem** [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/llm-agents)

**Coverage Requirements**:

**Practical Implementation**: The journey of multi-agent systems from prototype to production teaches critical lessons about **system architecture, tool design, and prompt engineering** [Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system).

**Key Principle**: **Start with simple prompts**, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems **only when simpler solutions fall short** [Anthropic Engineering Blog](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents).

**Success Factors**: Multi-agent research systems can operate reliably at scale with:
- Careful engineering
- Comprehensive testing

## 5. Long Context and Retrieval Integration

### 5.1 Long Context Capabilities

**Current State**: Recent models support **over 100,000 tokens** in a single prompt:
- Anthropic Claude: **200k tokens**
- GPT-4-turbo: **128k tokens**
- OpenAI o1: **128k tokens**
- Google Gemini 1.5 Pro: **2 million tokens** [arXiv:2407.16833](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.16833v1)

**Performance Characteristics**: The best commercial models such as **o1-mini/preview, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet** show **consistent accuracy improvement up to 100k tokens**. However, most model performance decreases after a certain context size:
- Llama-3.1-405b: Decreases after **32k tokens**
- GPT-4-0125-preview: Decreases after **64k tokens**
- Only a few models maintaining consistent long context RAG performance on all datasets [Databricks Blog](https://www.databricks.com/blog/long-context-rag-performance-llms)

**Limitation**: While recent LLMs support large contexts, simply enlarging context windows has **not guaranteed robust multi-hop reasoning** when key details are scattered across massive input [arXiv:2411.03538](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.03538v1).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- When to use long context vs RAG
- Context window optimization
- Performance characteristics by model
- Multi-hop reasoning strategies
- Cost-performance trade-offs

---

### 5.2 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Definition**: RAG has emerged as a crucial technique for enhancing the accuracy of Large Language Models by **incorporating external information** [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/rag).

**RAG vs Long Context Trade-offs**: Analysis reveals that predictions from long-context and RAG are **identical for over 60% of queries**, leading to the development of **Self-Route**, a method that routes various queries to RAG or long context based on model self-reflection, **significantly reducing cost** while achieving overall performance comparable to long context [arXiv:2407.16833](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.16833v1).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Retrieval strategy design
- Chunk size optimization
- Reranking techniques
- RAG vs long context decision making
- Hybrid approaches

---

### 5.3 Advanced RAG Techniques

**Emulating RAG Through Prompt Engineering**: A method emulates Retrieval Augmented Generation through specialized prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning by treating the model as **both the retriever and the reasoner**, first tagging relevant segments within a long passage, then employing stepwise reasoning [arXiv:2502.12462](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.12462v1).

**Document's Original Structure (DOS) RAG**: DOS RAG maintains a simple **retrieve-then-read strategy** and presents retrieved passages in their **original document order**, and despite its simplicity can **match or even outperform** more complex multi-stage pipelines [arXiv:2506.03989](https://arxiv.org/html/2506.03989v1).

**Recursive Retrieval**: Involves a recursive process that might start with **small semantic chunks** and subsequently retrieve **larger chunks** that enrich the context, useful to balance efficiency and context-rich information [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/rag).

**Performance Insight**: Retrieving more information for a given query increases the likelihood that the right information is passed on to the LLM, and **modern LLMs with long context lengths can take advantage** of this to improve the overall RAG system [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/).

**Cost Considerations**: Since the RAG-and-Route step only needs the retrieved chunks (e.g., **1.5k tokens**) as input, which is significantly shorter than the full contexts (e.g., 10k-100k tokens), the overall **computation cost is substantially reduced** [arXiv:2407.16833](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.16833v1).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Prompt-based retrieval strategies
- Document structure preservation
- Recursive retrieval patterns
- Cost-performance optimization

**Model Evolution**: GPT-4.1 is trained to follow instructions **more closely and more literally** than predecessors, requiring more explicit specification around what to do or not to do [OpenAI Cookbook GPT-4.1](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Explicit vs implicit instructions
- Literal instruction following
- Model-specific instruction styles
- Alignment considerations

---

### 6.3 Behavior Steering and Activation Steering

## 7. Security and Robustness

### 7.1 Prompt Injection Threats

**Overview**: Prompt injection vulnerabilities occur when user prompts **alter the LLM's behavior or output in unintended ways** [OWASP Gen AI](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm01-prompt-injection/).

**Fundamental Challenge**: LLMs cannot inherently distinguish between **system prompts** (which define the model's task) and **user prompts** (which query the model), and without robust mechanisms to separate these inputs, malicious actors can hijack model behavior [NVIDIA Technical Blog](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/securing-llm-systems-against-prompt-injection/).

**Types of Attacks**:
- **Direct prompt injections**: User's prompt input directly alters the behavior of the model in unintended ways
- **Indirect prompt injections**: LLM accepts input from external sources (websites, files), and external content alters model behavior
- **Multimodal attacks**: Malicious actors exploit interactions between modalities, such as hiding instructions in images [arXiv:2509.05883](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.05883v1)

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Prompt injection detection
- Input sanitization strategies
- Context isolation techniques
- Defense in depth approaches
- Testing for robustness

---

### 7.2 Defense Strategies

**Alignment-Based Approaches**: Alignment can be a powerful tool to make LLMs **more robust against prompt injection**. Research shows that fine-tuning-based defenses are very similar to **adversarial training** in classical machine learning [arXiv:2410.05451](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.05451v1).

**Multi-Layered Defense**: Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of **layered and adaptive defense strategies**, integrating multiple safeguards across the model lifecycle [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S111001682500328X).

**Defensive Measures**:
- Robust input handling and sanitization
- Context isolation
- Privilege restriction
- Output validation
- Resilient prompt engineering [OWASP Gen AI](https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm01-prompt-injection/)

**Multi-Agent Defense**: A multi-agent defense framework achieved **complete mitigation** of prompt injection attacks, reducing the **Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0%** across 55 unique adversarial cases [arXiv:2509.14285](https://arxiv.org/html/2509.14285).

**Instruction Hierarchy**: The instruction hierarchy framework teaches language models to follow instructions while ignoring adversarial manipulation, and improves **safety results by up to 63%** [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/ML_NEWS3/reports/Securing-your-LLM-applications-against-prompt-injection-attacks--VmlldzoxMDQxODE5Ng).

**Current Limitations**: Given the stochastic influence at the heart of the way models work, it is **unclear if there are fool-proof methods** of prevention for prompt injection [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://www.promptingguide.ai/risks/adversarial).

**Model Comparison**: Comparative analysis indicated that **Claude 3 demonstrated relatively greater robustness**; nevertheless, empirical findings confirm that additional defenses, such as input normalization, remain necessary to achieve reliable protection [Label Your Data](https://labelyourdata.com/articles/llm-fine-tuning/prompt-injection).

**Coverage Requirements**:
- Defense strategy selection
- Multi-layered security architecture
- Model-specific robustness characteristics
- Testing and red-teaming approaches
- Monitoring and detection

## Conclusion

This component documented comprehensive coverage requirements across all major prompting use cases, identifying 13 distinct pattern categories from fundamental (zero-shot, few-shot) to advanced (graph of thoughts, multi-agent systems). The analysis reveals strong coverage in basic techniques but significant gaps in multi-turn conversations, security/robustness, and practical agent architectures. A complete prompting framework must address these gaps while providing model-specific guidance and clear decision criteria for technique selection.
