## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Research moves faster than we can publish
**Mitigation:** Quarterly update cycle, living framework model, focus on mechanistic understanding (more durable than specific techniques)

### Risk: Low initial adoption
**Mitigation:** Aggressive social proof campaign, partnerships with AI tool companies, free certification program

### Risk: Academic gatekeeping delays papers
**Mitigation:** ArXiv pre-prints ensure immediate availability, pursue both conference and journal tracks

### Risk: Content proliferation (too many resources)
**Mitigation:** Clear navigation, progressive disclosure, recommended reading paths, executive summaries

### Risk: Community toxicity or misuse
**Mitigation:** Code of conduct, moderation resources, clear ethical guidelines, no support for malicious use

## Conclusion

This multi-tier, multi-channel approach ensures our evidence-based prompting framework reaches from cutting-edge researchers to everyday AI users while maintaining scientific rigor. By creating comprehensive foundational content and atomizing it across formats, we maximize reach and impact while efficiently using resources.

**Next Priority:** Develop first blog post (Part 1: "Why Most People Are Prompting Wrong") as validation of audience interest and content quality before full commitment to 12-month roadmap.
