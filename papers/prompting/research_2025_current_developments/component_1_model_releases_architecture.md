## 1. REASONING MODELS REVOLUTION (Sept 2024 - Present)

### 1.1 OpenAI o-Series Evolution

**o1 Release (September 2024)**
- First production reasoning model with extended chain-of-thought capabilities
- 128k token context window
- **Critical Prompting Change**: Simple zero-shot prompts outperform complex prompt engineering [Microsoft Azure AI, 2025](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azure-ai-services-blog/prompt-engineering-for-openai's-o1-and-o3-mini-reasoning-models/4374010)
- Traditional CoT prompting actually **degrades performance** - built-in reasoning makes it redundant

**o3-mini Release (January 31, 2025)**
- Cost-efficient reasoning model: much cheaper per token than o1
- 200k token context window (56% increase over o1)
- Three reasoning effort levels: low, medium, high - users control thinking depth
- Free tier access democratized reasoning capabilities [OpenAI, 2025](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/)

**o3 & o4-mini Release (April 16, 2025)**
- First reasoning models with **agentic tool use**: web browsing, Python execution, image generation, vision
- Can combine multiple tools autonomously during reasoning process
- Marked shift from "reasoning model" to "reasoning agent" [OpenAI, 2025](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/)

**Key Prompting Implications:**
- Developer messages replace system messages (alignment with model spec)
- Markdown formatting disabled by default - must explicitly request with "Formatting re-enabled"
- Minimal context preferred - excess information causes "overthinking"
- Complex prompt engineering techniques (few-shot, elaborate instructions) now counterproductive

- 80% fewer errors when using reasoning mode
- 50-80% fewer output tokens than o3 across capabilities [Botpress, 2025](https://botpress.com/blog/everything-you-should-know-about-gpt-5)

**Prompting Impact:**
- Users no longer choose between models manually
- System automatically escalates to reasoning when needed
- "Think step by step" prompts becoming obsolete for GPT-5

## 2. TEST-TIME COMPUTE SCALING PARADIGM SHIFT

**Fundamental Change in AI Capability Scaling**

Test-time compute emerged as the hottest topic in AI research for 2025:

### 2.1 Core Concept

**Definition**: Investing computational resources during inference (problem-solving) rather than only during training

**Performance Findings:**
- Compute-optimal scaling improves efficiency by **4x vs best-of-N baselines**
- Llama-3.2 3B with 256-iteration test-time compute **outperforms Llama-3.1 70B** (20x larger)
- Smaller models with test-time compute can beat 14x larger models [arXiv 2408.03314, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03314)

### 2.2 Mechanisms

**Two Primary Approaches:**
1. **Search against process-based verifier reward models**
2. **Adaptive distribution updates** - updating model's distribution during inference

Effectiveness varies by prompt difficulty â motivates **adaptive compute-optimal strategies**

### 2.3 Prompting Implications

**Death of Traditional Prompt Engineering?**

Key findings from 2025 research:
- "Tell the model to think step by step" **becoming obsolete** for many use cases
- Clever prompt chaining may become unnecessary
- Simply prompting models to correct mistakes is **largely ineffective** for reasoning
- Chain-of-Thought prompting has limitations: errors compound without validation

**Future Direction:**
- Same model delivers different intelligence levels based on allocated thinking time
- Relationship between compute and capability intensifies
- Internal reasoning mechanisms replace explicit prompt engineering [Sebastian Raschka, 2025](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/state-of-llm-reasoning-and-inference-scaling.html)

- Industry-best 10M token context (Scout) via "iRoPE" architecture technique
- Single GPU processing of massive contexts [Meta AI, 2025](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/)

### 3.3 Prompting Strategies for Multimodal

**Multi-Modal Chain of Thought (GPT-4o):**
- Reasons about how to break problems across modalities first
- Then executes steps across text, vision, audio
- Single unified model handles all modality transitions

**Challenges Revealed in 2025:**
- Models "good on average" but **struggle with demanding computer vision tasks**
- Counting objects in complex images remains difficult despite multimodal capabilities
- Gap between general multimodal understanding and specialized CV tasks

## 5. LONG CONTEXT: REALITY VS PROMISES

### 5.1 Current State (2025)

**Available Context Windows:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5, GPT-4.1, Llama 4 Maverick**: 1M tokens
- **Llama 4 Scout**: 10M tokens on single GPU
- **Magic LTM-2-Mini**: 100M tokens

### 5.2 Practical Limitations Discovered in 2025

**Performance Degradation:**
- Models **do not use context uniformly**
- Performance grows **increasingly unreliable as input length grows**
- Non-uniform degradation patterns discovered
- "Context rot" phenomenon documented [Chroma Research: Context Rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot)

**Training vs Declared Context:**
- 10M declared context is **"virtual"**
- No model trained on prompts longer than 256k tokens
- Sending >256k tokens yields **low-quality output most of the time**
- Gap between marketing and reality

**Resource Demands:**
- Substantial computational resources for million-token processing
- Increased latency
- Higher operational costs

### 5.3 RAG Still Relevant

Despite 10M token contexts, RAG remains relevant for:
- Cloud-scale enterprise deployments
- Performance optimization
- Cost management
- Accuracy in retrieval scenarios
