# Agent Instructions: Rewrite Post2 Delegation Blog with Adaptation Framing

## Content Type: Blog Post (Major Reframing Task)

---

## CRITICAL CONTEXT: User Correction

**What happened:**
- Previous IMPROVED_POST_PLAN.md used "inversion" framing
- User feedback: This creates PANIC ("everything breaks")
- User wants: Build CONFIDENCE ("adapt what you know")

**User's key principle:**
> "Show that existing management approaches are useful WITH AI, but should be ADAPTED. This removes panic of 'new empty area.' Many great things already exist in people and team management - you should just properly use and adopt them."

---

## Your Task

**Rewrite** the delegation blog post using adaptation framing instead of inversion framing.

**NOT:** Create new content or research new sources
**YES:** Reframe existing research (240+ sources from Tasks 1-8) to emphasize adaptation

## Critical Framing Requirements

### Language to USE (Adaptation Framing)

**✅ Confidence-building language:**
- "You already know delegation - here's how to adapt it"
- "Proven principles transfer WITH adaptation"
- "The 21% adapted existing competencies"
- "Your delegation wisdom is valuable"
- "Classical principle + AI adaptation"
- "Evolution, not revolution"
- "Build on what you know"
- "Adapt methods, keep principles"

**✅ Continuity emphasis:**
- "Drucker's skill-matching principle still applies"
- "Classical risk-based oversight transfers"
- "Proven task decomposition extended"
- "Same foundation, adapted methods"

**✅ Success framing:**
- "21% adapted workflows successfully"
- "Lumen kept sales expertise, adapted delivery"
- "Adaptation beats both revolution and status quo"

### Language to AVOID (Inversion Framing)

**❌ Panic-inducing language:**
- "Everything inverts with AI"
- "Every assumption breaks"
- "Five inversions that break delegation"
- "AI is alien and incomprehensible"
- "Start from scratch"
- "Your knowledge doesn't work"
- "Revolutionary new frameworks needed"

**❌ Failure emphasis:**
- "Human delegation completely fails for AI"
- "All assumptions violated"
- "Management wisdom worthless"
- "No principles transfer"

## Reframing the Five Findings (CRITICAL)

### Finding #1: Human-AI Performs Worse (g=-0.23)

**OLD framing (creates panic):**
> "Human oversight makes AI WORSE. Human-AI combinations performed worse than AI alone. Adding human oversight decreased performance by 14 points. HITL fails."

**NEW framing (adaptation requirement):**
> "Human oversight is a proven principle that needs task-specific adaptation for AI. Meta-analysis shows: HITL helps content creation tasks, but can degrade decision-making tasks (g=-0.23). Medical diagnosis: GPT-4 alone 90%, physicians + GPT-4 76%. The adaptation: Match oversight architecture to task type, not universal HITL. Classical 'risk-based supervision' principle transfers—but must account for task-specificity and automation bias."

**Key shift:** From "oversight fails" to "oversight needs task-specific adaptation"

---

### Finding #2: Delegation Increases Dishonesty (88% vs. 5%)

**OLD framing (creates panic):**
> "AI delegation makes humans 17.6x more dishonest. 88% vs. 5% dishonesty rate. Delegation to AI corrupts human behavior. Moral hazard crisis."

**NEW framing (adaptation requirement):**
> "AI delegation requires adapted accountability structures. Nature 2025 study: Delegation to AI increased dishonest behavior from 5% to 88% through moral disengagement mechanism ('I didn't cheat—the AI did'). The adaptation: Classical delegation includes ethical oversight—with AI, must build explicit moral accountability into verification protocols. Stage 1 adds ethical risk assessment; Stage 3 includes ethical compliance verification. The proven principle (accountability) transfers—the method (explicit ethical verification) adapts for AI's different properties."

**Key shift:** From "delegation corrupts" to "accountability structures need adaptation"

---

### Finding #3: Only 21% Redesigned Workflows

**OLD framing (creates panic):**
> "79% fail because they don't transform. Technology adoption without organizational transformation = 80%+ failure rate. Most organizations are failing."

**NEW framing (confidence-building):**
> "The 21% who succeed adapted workflows to leverage AI's different properties. McKinsey 2025: Workflow adaptation is the #1 predictor of EBIT impact—and only 21% have done it. The insight: Lumen adapted sales workflows ($50M savings), ATB adapted marketing processes (60% more capacity), MAIRE adapted engineering workflows (doubling efficiency). They didn't abandon organizational competencies—they adapted workflows for AI's strengths. The proven principle (process improvement) transfers—the method (redesign for AI properties, not just automation) is the adaptation. Adaptation beats both revolution and status quo."

**Key shift:** From "most fail" to "21% show how to adapt successfully"

---

### Finding #4: Reliable AI Creates Worse Automation Bias

**OLD framing (creates panic):**
> "Better AI is more dangerous. The more reliable AI, the worse automation bias. Reliable automation breeds complacency. 99% reliability creates catastrophic 1% failures."

**NEW framing (adaptation requirement):**
> "High-performing AI requires adapted vigilance strategies. Proven principle: Match supervision to capability. With humans, higher competence = less supervision. With AI, inverse relationship: Higher AI reliability requires HIGHER human vigilance (automation bias risk). Radiology study: 79.7% accuracy with correct AI → 19.8% with incorrect AI (4x swing). The adaptation: Active monitoring protocols for high-performing AI, not passive review. Parasuraman (2010): Reliable automation breeds complacency—the classical finding still applies, but AI's confidence without metacognition amplifies the risk. Classical oversight principle transfers—vigilance protocols must adapt inversely to AI reliability."

**Key shift:** From "reliable AI is dangerous" to "oversight vigilance adapts inversely to AI reliability"

---

### Finding #5: Success Rates Collapse With Variations (50%→25%)

**OLD framing (creates panic):**
> "AI is brittle and unpredictable. Success in testing → failure in production. 50% → 25% collapse. Testing lies. You can't trust AI."

**NEW framing (adaptation requirement):**
> "Testing methods must adapt to include variation scenarios explicitly. Classical principle: Test before deploying. With humans, success on Task A predicts success on similar Task B (learning transfer). With AI, no learning transfer—must test variations explicitly. Research: 50% success on individual tasks → 25% with minor variations. McDonald's: 80% accuracy testing vs. 95% target production. The adaptation: Classical 'test incrementally' principle transfers—but testing method must include edge cases, variations, unexpected inputs explicitly. Stage 2 (Capability Mapping) operationalizes this: Test on real samples with variations, not just structured success scenarios."

**Key shift:** From "AI is brittle, can't trust" to "testing methods need adaptation for variation scenarios"

---

## Adaptation Framework Table (Replaces Comparison Table)

**OLD table structure (failure-focused):**
| Dimension | Human | AI | Implication |
| Skill | Works this way | BREAKS completely | Can't trust AI |

**NEW table structure (adaptation-focused):**
| Management Principle | Classical Application (Human) | AI Adaptation Needed | How to Apply (Framework Stage) |
| Verify skills before delegating (Drucker) | Interview, resume, references | Can't interview - empirical testing required | Stage 2: Capability Mapping |

**For EACH principle in table:**
1. Name the CLASSICAL principle (Drucker, Mintzberg, HBR)
2. Show how it works with humans
3. Explain why DIRECT application fails (AI properties different)
4. Show how to ADAPT the method (keep principle, change implementation)
5. Map to framework stage

**Five principles to cover:**
1. Verify skills (Drucker 1967)
2. Match oversight to risk (Classical management)
3. Break complex work into tasks (Classical decomposition)
4. Test in low-stakes before high-stakes (Classical incrementalism)
5. Clear role boundaries (Classical role definition)

**Key message:** "Five proven principles. All transfer. All need method adaptation."

## Success Cases: Adaptation Stories (Not Revolution Stories)

### Lumen Technologies

**DON'T say:**
- "Lumen revolutionized their sales process"
- "Lumen abandoned traditional sales approaches"
- "Lumen did something completely different"

**DO say:**
- "Lumen adapted their sales process for AI's different properties"
- "What they KEPT: Sales expertise, customer relationship focus"
- "What they ADAPTED: AI handles research phase, humans focus on relationships"
- "Classical principle (role clarity) + AI adaptation (leverage AI research capability)"
- **Result:** $50M savings by adapting workflow, not abandoning competencies

### ATB Financial

**DON'T say:**
- "ATB created entirely new methodology"
- "ATB threw out pilot-test-scale approach"

**DO say:**
- "ATB adapted their proven pilot methodology for AI verification needs"
- "What they KEPT: Pilot-test-scale discipline, measurement practices"
- "What they ADAPTED: Tested with hundreds for capability verification (Stage 2)"
- "Classical principle (incremental rollout) + AI adaptation (empirical capability testing)"
- **Result:** 60% more capacity by adapting change management for AI properties

### MAIRE

**DON'T say:**
- "MAIRE revolutionized engineering workflows"
- "MAIRE abandoned engineering best practices"

**DO say:**
- "MAIRE adapted engineering workflows with new infrastructure"
- "What they KEPT: Measurement discipline, systematic documentation"
- "What they ADAPTED: Created 'Human in Loop' portal (infrastructure for AI properties)"
- "Classical principle (measurement-driven improvement) + AI adaptation (oversight infrastructure)"
- **Result:** 800→1,600 hours/month by adapting systematic approach for AI integration

---

## Failures: Missed Adaptation Opportunities (Not Incompetence)

### McDonald's

**DON'T say:**
- "McDonald's failed completely"
- "McDonald's was incompetent"

**DO say:**
- "McDonald's had strong drive-thru processes but missed workflow adaptation"
- "What they HAD: Proven operations, quality standards"
- "What they MISSED: Adaptation for AI brittleness (Finding #5)"
- "Deployed AI as drop-in replacement instead of adaptation partner"
- **Lesson:** Technology adoption ≠ workflow adaptation

### Air Canada

**DON'T say:**
- "Air Canada's customer service was worthless"
- "Air Canada completely failed at AI"

**DO say:**
- "Air Canada had good customer service but missed protocol adaptation"
- "What they HAD: Policy knowledge, service standards"
- "What they MISSED: Adaptation for AI overconfidence (Finding #1)"
- "Deployed chatbot without adapting oversight for confidence calibration failures"
- **Lesson:** Strong processes fail without adaptation for AI properties
