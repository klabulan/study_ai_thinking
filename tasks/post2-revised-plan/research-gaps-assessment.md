# Research Gaps Assessment: Adaptation vs. Revolution Framing

**Assessment Date:** 2025-10-13
**Context:** User correction - emphasize adaptation of existing frameworks, not revolutionary replacement

---

## USER'S CRITICAL CORRECTION

**Lost Key Idea:**
> "Show that existing management approaches are useful WITH AI, but should be ADAPTED. This removes panic of 'new empty area.' Many great things already exist in people and team management - you should just properly use and adopt them."

**Problem with IMPROVED_POST_PLAN.md:**
- Framing: "Five inversions" + "everything breaks with AI"
- Effect: Creates panic, suggests starting from scratch
- Reality: OPPOSITE of user's vision

**User's Actual Vision:**
- Existing management knowledge IS valuable
- Proven delegation principles DO apply to AI
- Challenge is ADAPTATION, not revolution
- Build confidence: "You already know how to delegate"
- Emphasize what TRANSFERS from human management
- Show evolution of existing frameworks, not abandonment

---

## RESEARCH GAP ANALYSIS

### What We HAVE (Good News)

**1. Evidence of What TRANSFERS:**

**Drucker/Mintzberg Principles (Task 6) - ADAPTABLE:**
- ✅ **Skill-task matching**: Still applies, but method changes
  - Human: Interview, observe track record
  - AI: Test on representative samples (Stage 2: Capability Mapping)
  - **ADAPTATION:** Same principle (match skills to tasks), different verification method

- ✅ **Risk-based delegation**: Core principle TRANSFERS
  - Human: Delegate low-stakes first, expand gradually
  - AI: Stage 1 (Decomposition & Risk Assessment) uses SAME logic
  - **ADAPTATION:** Same framework, AI-specific risk dimensions

- ✅ **Clear boundaries**: Principle TRANSFERS
  - Human: Negotiate autonomy, test incrementally
  - AI: Stage 3 (Oversight Protocol) codifies SAME idea
  - **ADAPTATION:** Same goal (define limits), explicit vs. negotiated

**2. Three-Stage Framework IS ADAPTATION of Existing Management:**

**Stage 1: Task Decomposition & Risk Assessment**
- **Classical management:** Break complex work into manageable tasks
- **AI adaptation:** Add AI-specific risk dimensions (overconfidence, brittleness)
- **What TRANSFERS:** Task decomposition itself
- **What CHANGES:** Risk assessment criteria

**Stage 2: Capability Mapping**
- **Classical management:** Interview, reference checks, trial projects
- **AI adaptation:** Test on representative samples, document performance distribution
- **What TRANSFERS:** "Verify before delegating" principle
- **What CHANGES:** Can't interview AI, must test empirically

**Stage 3: Oversight Protocol Design**
- **Classical management:** Match supervision to risk and competence
- **AI adaptation:** HITL/HOTL/HFTL taxonomy codifies SAME principle
- **What TRANSFERS:** Risk-based oversight matching
- **What CHANGES:** Must account for automation bias, can't improve AI through feedback

**3. 21% Success Cases (Task 4) - ADAPTED Existing Workflows:**

**Lumen Technologies:**
- Didn't abandon sales process
- **ADAPTED:** AI handles research phase, humans handle relationships
- **Transferred:** Clear role boundaries, human strengths focus
- **Result:** 94% time reduction

**ATB Financial:**
- Didn't abandon marketing workflows
- **ADAPTED:** Pilot-test-scale methodology WITH redesign
- **Transferred:** Incremental rollout, capability verification
- **Result:** 60% took on more responsibility

**MAIRE:**
- Didn't abandon engineering workflows
- **ADAPTED:** Created new "Human in Loop" portal
- **Transferred:** Oversight principle, measurement discipline
- **Result:** 800→1,600 hours/month saved (doubling after initial phase)

### What We NEED (Research Gaps)

**Gap #1: Explicit "What Transfers" Framework**

**Current state:**
- Research shows adaptation examples
- But framing emphasizes "inversion/breaking"
- Missing: Systematic "Here's what transfers, here's how to adapt it" framework

**What we need:**
- Reframe Task 3 comparison table
- Current: "Human works this way | AI breaks it"
- Better: "Human principle | AI adaptation | How to apply it"

**Evidence we already have (just needs reframing):**
- Drucker skill matching → AI capability testing (Stage 2)
- Mintzberg resource allocation → AI task decomposition (Stage 1)
- HBR trust calibration → AI oversight protocols (Stage 3)

**New research needed?** NO - reframe existing research

---

**Gap #2: Success Stories Emphasizing Continuity**

**Current state:**
- Task 4 has 12 organizations
- But framing emphasizes "succeeded because DIFFERENT"
- Missing: "succeeded because ADAPTED existing strengths"

**What we need:**
- Reframe Lumen: "Used existing sales process understanding, adapted delivery"
- Reframe ATB: "Used existing pilot methodology, adapted for AI properties"
- Reframe MAIRE: "Used existing measurement discipline, adapted infrastructure"

**Evidence we already have:**
- All success cases retained organizational competencies
- None started from scratch
- All adapted proven methods

**New research needed?** NO - reframe existing examples

---

**Gap #3: Failure Analysis as "Missed Adaptation Opportunities"**

**Current state:**
- McDonald's, Air Canada framed as "didn't redesign"
- True, but negative framing

**Better framing:**
- McDonald's: "Tried to automate WITHOUT adapting order-taking workflow for AI properties"
- Air Canada: "Deployed chatbot WITHOUT adapting customer service protocols for overconfidence risk"
- Both HAD existing workflows that worked
- Failed because treated AI as drop-in replacement vs. adaptation partner

**Evidence we already have:**
- Both failures stem from non-adaptation
- Both organizations had strong existing processes

**New research needed?** NO - reframe failures as adaptation lessons

---

**Gap #4: Five "Counterintuitive Findings" Need Reframing**

**Current framing creates panic:**

**Finding #1: Human-AI worse than AI alone (g=-0.23)**
- Current framing: "Oversight makes things WORSE"
- **Adaptation framing:** "Oversight works differently for AI - here's when/how to adapt it"
- **Key insight:** HITL helps content creation, degrades decision-making
- **Adaptation:** Task-specific oversight (existing principle: match supervision to task type)

**Finding #2: Delegation increases dishonesty 17.6x**
- Current framing: "Delegation creates moral hazard"
- **Adaptation framing:** "AI delegation requires adapted accountability structures"
- **Key insight:** Humans need moral ownership, not just process delegation
- **Adaptation:** Add ethical verification to oversight protocols (extends existing governance)

**Finding #3: Only 21% redesigned workflows**
- Current framing: "Most fail because don't transform"
- **Adaptation framing:** "The 21% who succeed ADAPT workflows to AI properties"
- **Key insight:** Adaptation beats both revolution and status quo
- **Transferred:** Organizational change management principles

**Finding #4: Reliable AI creates worse automation bias**
- Current framing: "Better AI is more dangerous"
- **Adaptation framing:** "Oversight vigilance must ADAPT as AI reliability increases"
- **Key insight:** Inverse relationship between AI reliability and required human vigilance
- **Adaptation:** Active monitoring strategies for high-performing AI (extends existing risk management)

**Finding #5: Success rates collapse with variations (50%→25%)**
- Current framing: "AI is brittle, can't trust it"
- **Adaptation framing:** "Testing methods must ADAPT to include variation scenarios"
- **Key insight:** Structured testing misleads; need variation-aware evaluation
- **Adaptation:** Stress testing, edge case analysis (extends existing QA practices)

**Evidence we already have:** All five findings
**New research needed?** NO - reframe as adaptation requirements, not inversions

---

### Gap #5: Confidence-Building Narrative Arc

**Current state (panic-inducing):**
- Act I: Paradox (safeguards failed)
- Act II: Everything breaks (comparison table of failures)
- Act III: New frameworks needed
- Act IV: This is harder than human delegation

**Better state (confidence-building):**
- Act I: Challenge (AI delegation requires adaptation)
- Act II: What transfers (proven principles + how to adapt them)
- Act III: Adaptation in action (21% success cases)
- Act IV: You have the foundation (build on existing knowledge)

**Evidence we already have:**
- Three-stage framework mirrors existing delegation stages
- 21% success cases retained organizational strengths
- Failures resulted from non-adaptation, not inadequacy

**New research needed?** NO - reframe narrative arc

---

## VERDICT: DO WE NEED NEW RESEARCH?

### Answer: NO - Reframe Existing Research

**What we have:**
- ✅ 240+ sources, 8 completed tasks
- ✅ Evidence of what transfers (Task 6: Drucker/Mintzberg/HBR)
- ✅ Adaptation examples (Task 4: Lumen/ATB/MAIRE)
- ✅ Framework that extends existing principles (Task 5: Three stages)
- ✅ Clear success pattern (Task 8: 21% workflow redesign)

**What we're missing:**
- ❌ Adaptation framing (currently "inversion" framing)
- ❌ Confidence-building narrative
- ❌ "Build on what you know" messaging
- ❌ Continuity emphasis

**Solution:**
- Reframe comparison table: "Principle | AI Adaptation | Application"
- Reframe five findings: Adaptation requirements, not inversions
- Reframe success cases: Adapted existing strengths
- Reframe failures: Missed adaptation opportunities
- Reframe framework: Evolutionary extension of proven principles

**Time to implement:** 4-6 hours (reframing existing content)
**New research time:** 0 hours
**Total:** Same research base, better framing
