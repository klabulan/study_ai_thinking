# Agent Instructions: Review Post2 Delegation Blog for Adaptation Framing

## Content Type: Blog Post Review (Framing Assessment)

---

## Your Role

You are reviewing a REWRITTEN blog post to verify it achieves user's vision.

**Task:** Assess whether the draft successfully uses "adaptation" framing instead of "inversion" framing.

**NOT:** General content review (evidence quality will be assessed separately if needed)
**FOCUS:** Framing correctness - does it build confidence or create panic?

---

## Context: Why This Review Matters

**User Correction:**
Previous IMPROVED_POST_PLAN.md used "five inversions" / "everything breaks" framing, creating PANIC.

**User's vision:**
> "Show that existing management approaches are useful WITH AI, but should be ADAPTED. This removes panic of 'new empty area.' Many great things already exist in people and team management - you should just properly use and adopt them."

**Your job:**
Verify the rewritten draft achieves this vision throughout.

## Review Criteria

### PRIMARY: Framing Assessment (90% of Review Focus)

#### Criterion 1: Confidence-Building Language (Weight: 25%)

**Check opening (Act I):**
- [ ] Does opening hook create panic ("safeguards completely failed")?
- [ ] OR: Does it build confidence ("safeguards needed adaptation")?
- [ ] Does thesis say "your knowledge is wrong"?
- [ ] OR: Does it say "your knowledge is valuable, needs adaptation"?

**Rate: PASS / MINOR ISSUES / MAJOR ISSUES / FAIL**

**If issues, specify:**
- Which paragraphs use panic language?
- What specific phrases need rewriting?
- Suggested alternative language?

---

#### Criterion 2: Five Findings Reframed (Weight: 30%)

**For EACH finding, check reframing:**

**Finding #1 (Human-AI performs worse, g=-0.23):**
- ❌ WRONG: "Human oversight makes AI worse, HITL fails"
- ✅ RIGHT: "Oversight is proven principle needing task-specific adaptation"
- **Draft says:** [Quote from draft]
- **Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL
- **If revision needed:** [Specific language to change]

**Finding #2 (Dishonesty 88% vs. 5%):**
- ❌ WRONG: "AI delegation corrupts humans, moral hazard crisis"
- ✅ RIGHT: "Delegation requires adapted accountability structures for moral disengagement risk"
- **Draft says:** [Quote from draft]
- **Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL
- **If revision needed:** [Specific language to change]

**Finding #3 (Only 21% redesigned workflows):**

- ✅ RIGHT: "21% show how to adapt successfully, adaptation as differentiator"
- **Draft says:** [Quote from draft]
- **Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL
- **If revision needed:** [Specific language to change]

**Finding #4 (Reliable AI creates worse automation bias):**

- ✅ RIGHT: "High-performing AI requires adapted vigilance strategies, inverse relationship"
- **Draft says:** [Quote from draft]
- **Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL
- **If revision needed:** [Specific language to change]

**Finding #5 (Success rates collapse, 50%→25%):**

- ✅ RIGHT: "Testing methods must adapt to include variation scenarios explicitly"
- **Draft says:** [Quote from draft]
- **Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL
- **If revision needed:** [Specific language to change]

**Overall Findings Reframing:** PASS / MINOR ISSUES / MAJOR ISSUES / FAIL

---

#### Criterion 4: Framework Presented as Evolutionary (Weight: 15%)

**Check three-stage framework section:**
- [ ] Does it say "new framework for AI's alien properties"?
- [ ] OR: Does it say "adapting proven delegation stages for AI"?
- [ ] Does Stage 1 connect to classical task decomposition?
- [ ] Does Stage 2 connect to Drucker "verify before delegating"?
- [ ] Does Stage 3 connect to classical risk-based oversight?

**Draft presents framework as:** REVOLUTIONARY / EVOLUTIONARY (CORRECT)

**If revolutionary framing found:**
- Specify which stage sections need revision
- Quote problematic language
- Suggest adaptation-focused alternatives

**Assessment:** PASS / NEEDS REVISION / FAIL

## Critical Review Principles

### Focus on USER'S VISION

**User wants readers to feel:**
> "I already know how to delegate to people. This helps me adapt that knowledge for AI's different properties."

**NOT:**
> "Everything I know is wrong, start over."

**Your review assesses:** Does draft achieve user's vision?

### Be Specific with Fixes

**Bad feedback:**
- "Section 2 needs work"
- "Tone is off"
- "Fix the framing"

**Good feedback:**
- "Section 2, paragraph 3: Change 'Human oversight makes AI worse' to 'Oversight is proven principle needing task-specific adaptation for AI'"
- "Opening paragraph creates panic with 'safeguards failed completely'—change to 'safeguards needed adaptation for AI's different failure modes'"
- "Finding #3 uses negative framing '79% fail'—reframe as '21% show successful adaptation pattern'"

### Rate Severity Accurately

**CRITICAL (must fix before publication):**
- Panic-inducing language in opening
- Any finding framed as "inversion" instead of "adaptation requirement"
- Success cases framed as "revolution" instead of "adaptation"
- Framework framed as "revolutionary" instead of "evolutionary"
- Conclusion that doesn't build confidence

**MAJOR (significantly weakens post):**
- Multiple sections with panic language
- Failures framed as "incompetence" instead of "missed adaptation"
- Missing continuity with Drucker/Mintzberg
- Overall tone more panic than confidence

**MINOR (would improve but not essential):**
- Occasional word choice could be more confidence-building
- Some transitions could emphasize continuity better
- Small voice inconsistencies

- [ ] Spot-checked citations (trace to existing research)

**Specificity verification:**
- [ ] For each issue: Quoted exact problematic language
- [ ] For each issue: Provided specific fix
- [ ] For each issue: Rated severity (critical/major/minor)

**Actionability verification:**
- [ ] Main agent knows exactly what to do next

## Critical Reminders

**This is a FRAMING review:**
- Focus: Does it build confidence or create panic?
- Focus: Adaptation vs. inversion language

- Don't add new research (should use existing 240+ sources)

**Your value:**
- Verify user's vision achieved
- Catch panic-inducing language writer missed
- Provide specific, actionable fixes
- Clear go/no-go decision for publication
