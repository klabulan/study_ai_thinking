# Revision Rationale: Post 2 Planning Documents

**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Revisions:** preliminary_plan.md → FINAL_POST_PLAN.md, research_plan.md → FINAL_RESEARCH_PLAN.md

## Executive Summary

**Original scope:** 30 research tasks, 20-27 hours, 85-120 sources → 40-60 citations
**Revised scope:** 8 research tasks, 12-18 hours, 20-30 sources → 12-18 citations

**Core change:** Transformed from comprehensive management theory survey into focused 2025 delegation decision framework anchored by comparison table.

## What We Cut (And Why)

### 1. Eliminated Entire Phase 7 (Management Theory Foundation)

**Original:** 4 tasks on classical delegation theory, trust frameworks, skill assessment, team coordination
- Task 7.1: Drucker, Mintzberg, classical delegation
- Task 7.2: Trust & verification in management
- Task 7.3: Skill assessment & development
- Task 7.4: Team coordination & communication

**Rationale for cutting:**
- Post 1 succeeded with minimal foundational theory (just enough Kahneman, Tversky)
- We were building a management textbook foundation to support a blog post
- 2025 urgency comes from "what's different NOW," not "here's 40 years of management science"
- Readers trust the blog voice to explain what's relevant—don't need academic scaffolding

**What we kept:** 1 consolidated task (Task 6: Management Theory Baseline) for minimal context only—2-3 foundational citations max, used as contrast points ("With humans we do X, with AI this fails because Y")

**Time saved:** 5-8 hours
**Complexity reduced:** Removed 4 tasks

---

### 2. Consolidated Phase 3 (Task Qualification) from 4 tasks → absorbed into Task 3

**Original:**
- Task 3.1: Bloom's Taxonomy, Cynefin Framework, Dreyfus Model, Wood 1986
- Task 3.2: AI task suitability studies
- Task 3.3: Benchmark limitations
- Task 3.4: AI-specific qualification systems

**Rationale for consolidation:**
- These four tasks all feed ONE section of the comparison table: "Skill qualification" dimension
- The comparison table doesn't need four separate research streams—it needs concrete examples of the human-AI difference
- Bloom's Taxonomy interesting but theoretical overkill for blog post
- Readers need to see "humans: credentials work, AI: benchmarks don't predict performance"—not a taxonomy tour

**How consolidated into Task 3 (Comparison Table Evidence):**
- Focus on empirical evidence of human vs AI qualification differences
- Benchmark gaming becomes ONE example under "why credentials don't work for AI"
- Task suitability studies feed directly into table dimensions
- Cut theoretical frameworks entirely—keep only applied examples

**Time saved:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 4 tasks to absorbed content

---

### 3. Consolidated Phase 1 (HITL) from 4 tasks → 1 task

**Original:**
- Task 1.1: Medical HITL
- Task 1.2: Legal HITL
- Task 1.3: Automation complacency
- Task 1.4: HITL scalability

**Rationale for consolidation:**
- All four support the SAME thesis: "HITL works but isn't enough"
- Don't need four separate research streams—need 2-3 compelling examples
- Medical + Legal: pick ONE strong case for success, ONE for limitation
- Automation complacency: classic Parasuraman citation + one 2025 example sufficient
- Scalability: describe the problem, don't survey entire scalability literature

**How consolidated into Task 2 (HITL Reality Check):**
- 2-3 domains total (not exhaustive survey)
- Success rates + limitations in single unified search
- One strong example each of success and bottleneck
- Automation complacency folded in as "why supervision degrades"

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 4 tasks to 1 task

---

### 4. Consolidated Phase 2 (AI vs Human) from 5 tasks → absorbed into Task 3

**Original:**
- Task 2.1: Classical delegation theory + modern applications
- Task 2.2: AI capability evaluations
- Task 2.3: AI error patterns
- Task 2.4: Motivation structures
- Task 2.5: Real failures

**Rationale for consolidation:**
- Tasks 2.2-2.5 all feed comparison table dimensions directly
- Task 2.1 (delegation theory) moved to minimal baseline (Task 6)
- These aren't separate research questions—they're EVIDENCE for table rows
- Each task was designed to fill one table dimension: qualification, error patterns, motivation absence

**How consolidated:**
- Task 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 → absorbed into Task 3 (Comparison Table Evidence)
- Task 2.5 (real failures) → absorbed into Task 1 (Opening Hook) and Task 4 (Organizational Examples)
- Research now organized by "what evidence proves each table row?" not "what does literature say about X?"

**Time saved:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 5 tasks to absorbed content

---

### 5. Consolidated Phase 4 (Team Management) from 4 tasks → absorbed into Task 4

**Original:**
- Task 4.1: Agile/Scrum with AI
- Task 4.2: AI pair programming
- Task 4.3: Organizational AI adoption
- Task 4.4: Hybrid team composition

**Rationale for consolidation:**
- These four tasks support ONE section: "What actually works—emerging practices"
- Don't need four methodology explorations—need 2-3 concrete organizational examples
- Agile/Scrum: interesting but potentially narrow (not all readers use Agile)
- Pair programming: specific case of broader "team adaptation" pattern

**How consolidated into Task 4 (Organizational Adaptation Examples):**
- 2-3 companies that succeeded with AI delegation (what practices?)
- 2-3 that failed (what went wrong?)
- Look for patterns across cases, not methodology-specific studies
- If Agile adaptation appears in cases, cite it—but don't dedicate separate task

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 4 tasks to 1 task

---

### 6. Consolidated Phase 5 (Accountability) from 4 tasks → absorbed into Task 5

**Original:**
- Task 5.1: Accountability in regulated industries
- Task 5.2: AI logging/provenance
- Task 5.3: Error attribution
- Task 5.4: Oversight taxonomies

**Rationale for consolidation:**
- All four support proposed three-stage framework
- Don't need four separate explorations—need validation that the framework makes sense
- Regulatory focus (5.1) too narrow—most readers aren't in regulated industries
- Technical logging (5.2) too detailed for blog post scope
- Error attribution and oversight taxonomies are core—keep these but combined

**How consolidated into Task 5 (Three-Stage Framework Validation):**
- Find research/practice supporting framework stages
- Oversight level taxonomy (HITL/HOTL/HFTL) as framework element
- Error attribution as part of Stage 3 (oversight protocol design)
- Skip deep regulatory dive and technical logging systems

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 4 tasks to 1 task

---

### 7. Streamlined Phase 6 (Case Studies) from 5 tasks → distributed

**Original:**
- Task 6.1: Opening hook
- Task 6.2: HITL successes
- Task 6.3: Capability boundaries
- Task 6.4: Organizational integration
- Task 6.5: Team adaptation

**Rationale for redistribution:**
- Case studies aren't a separate research phase—they're EXAMPLES supporting other tasks
- Opening hook (6.1) is critical—keep as Task 1 (priority #1)
- Other case tasks duplicate content from Phases 1-4

**How redistributed:**
- Task 6.1 → Task 1 (Opening Hook Case Study) - PRIORITY 1
- Task 6.2 → absorbed into Task 2 (HITL Reality Check)
- Task 6.3 → absorbed into Task 3 (Comparison Table Evidence)
- Task 6.4, 6.5 → absorbed into Task 4 (Organizational Adaptation)

**Time saved:** 3-4 hours
**Complexity reduced:** From 5 dedicated tasks to distributed examples

---

## How We Shifted to 2025 Focus

### Original Problem: 60% historical, 40% current

**Examples of historical over-indexing in original plan:**
- Phase 7 entirely dedicated to classical management theory (Drucker, Mintzberg)
- Phase 3 Task 3.1: Bloom's Taxonomy (1956), Cynefin (1999), Dreyfus (1980), Wood (1986)
- Phase 1 Task 1.3: "Ironies of automation" (Bainbridge 1983)
- Phase 2 Task 2.1: Classical delegation frameworks

**These aren't wrong—they're CONTEXT. But they dominated research plan.**

### Revised Approach: 75-80% current, 20-25% foundational

**Every task now leads with 2025:**

**Task 1 (Opening Hook):** "Must be 2024-2025 incident"
**Task 2 (HITL Reality Check):** "2024-2025 studies showing scalability limits"
**Task 3 (Comparison Table):** "Focus on 2024-2025 organizational experiences"
**Task 4 (Organizational Adaptation):** "2-3 companies in 2024-2025"
**Task 5 (Framework Validation):** "2024-2025 practices that match framework stages"
**Task 7 (2025 AI Developments):** Entire task dedicated to "what changed THIS YEAR"

**Task 6 (Management Baseline):** ONLY historical task—explicitly minimal (1 hour, 2-3 citations)

**Foundational research used strategically:**
- As contrast: "Drucker said X, but with AI..."
- As mechanism: "Tversky's anchoring explains why..."
- As analogy: "Like factory automation in 1980s, but..."

**Never as primary evidence.**

### Why This Creates Urgency

**Post 1 opened with:**
- "2025 study"
- "December 2024"
- "February 2025"
- "March 2025"
- "May 2025"

**Creates reader thought:** "This is happening RIGHT NOW. I need to understand THIS."

**Post 2 revised plan creates same urgency:**
- "In 2025, [shocking statistic] forced companies to admit..."
- "March 2025 organizational failure where..."
- "2024-2025 companies that tried [approach]—here's what happened"

**Test passed:** Reader can finish: "I need to read this now because in 2025, ________"

---

## How We Preserved Discovery Potential

### Original Problem: 30 over-specified tasks = tunnel vision

**Example from original plan:**
- Task 3.1: "Find: Bloom's Taxonomy, Cynefin Framework, Dreyfus Model, Wood 1986"
  → Pre-decided exactly what to find
  → No room for surprising 2025 alternative frameworks
  → Guaranteed to produce predictable output

**Result:** Research becomes checklist execution, not exploration

### Revised Approach: 8 focused questions with "discovery zones"

**Each task now has:**
1. **Core question** - what we need to answer
2. **Expected sources** - where to look
3. **Discovery zone** - what unexpected findings would be valuable

**Example - Task 3 (Comparison Table Evidence):**

**Core question:** For each dimension of comparison table, find 1-2 studies showing human vs AI difference

**Expected sources:** 2024-2025 organizational experiences, AI capability evaluations, error pattern studies

**Discovery zone:**
- Counterintuitive dimension we missed (5th or 6th table row we didn't anticipate)
- Surprising finding that a "known" dimension doesn't actually matter
- Unexpected success pattern (companies doing OPPOSITE of best practices)

**Example - Task 8 (Surprise Factor Research):**

**Entire task is a discovery zone:**
- Explicitly: "Look for counterintuitive findings"
- "Everyone thinks X, but research shows Y"
- "The #1 predictor wasn't [expected] but [surprising]"

**This task has NO pre-specified answers—only instruction to find surprising patterns.**

### Philosophical Shift

**Original plan:** "Survey the literature comprehensively"
→ Produces thorough but predictable output
→ 30 tasks ensure nothing surprising emerges (no room for serendipity)

**Revised plan:** "Answer focused questions, stay alert for surprises"
→ 8 tasks leave space for unexpected findings
→ Task 8 explicitly hunts for "wait, WHAT?" moments
→ Each task has permission to pivot if better evidence appears

**Post 1 succeeded because of surprises:**
- "Study that should have made headlines" (conspiracy curiosity)
- "Only 6.9% improvement from awareness" (shocking)
- "Bias inheritance for weeks" (creepy)

**Post 2 needs equivalent—can't engineer surprise with 30 pre-specified tasks.**

---

## Comparison Table as Organizing Principle

### Original Plan: Comparison table was Section 2 of Act II

**Structure:**
- Act II, Section 2: "AI vs Human Employees—Where Management Frameworks Break"
- Table introduced (lines 54-61)
- Research Phase 2 tasks 2.1-2.5 fed this section
- But table wasn't the skeleton—just one element

**Problem:** Best idea undersupported by research structure

### Revised Plan: Comparison table IS the skeleton

**New structure:**

**Every research task cites which table dimension it supports:**
- Task 2 (HITL Reality Check) → informs "Autonomy boundaries" row
- Task 3 (Comparison Table Evidence) → DIRECTLY fills all five dimensions with citations
- Task 4 (Organizational Examples) → shows table dimensions in action
- Task 5 (Framework Validation) → framework ADDRESSES table dimension problems

**Post structure now:**

1. **Opening:** Failure case that exposes need for comparison table
2. **Section 1:** "Why treating AI like employee fails"
   - Introduce comparison table
   - Deep dive on 2-3 most dramatic dimensions with examples
3. **Section 2:** "What actually works"
   - Three-stage framework emerges FROM table insights
   - Each framework stage addresses specific dimension problems
4. **Conclusion:** Honest about remaining hard problems

**Every section references table. Every example reinforces a dimension.**

### Why This Works

**From review:**
> "The comparison table concept is gold... exactly the kind of practical framework readers need"

**Post 1 had:** Three mechanisms creating bias inheritance
→ Clear, memorable, actionable

**Post 2 has:** Comparison table dimensions
→ Visual, scannable, shows specific failure points, actionable for decisions

**Table is Post 2's equivalent of Post 1's mechanisms—the memorable practical core.**

## ONE Core Question (Simplified from 9 Questions)

### Original Plan Tried to Answer:

1. Why human-in-the-loop succeeds but isn't enough
2. Where AI breaks all management frameworks
3. Why task qualification doesn't work for AI
4. How to create new delegation protocols
5. Why error attribution systems fail
6. How team composition needs rethinking
7. What accountability boundaries look like
8. How oversight protocols should work
9. Why this is harder than hiring humans

**That's 9 major analytical questions for 4,500 words.**

### Revised Plan Answers ONE Question:

**"How do you decide what to delegate to AI?"**

**Everything else supports this decision:**
- HITL limitations → informs delegation boundaries
- Comparison table → shows why human intuition fails
- Organizational examples → demonstrate decision framework in action
- Three-stage framework → IS the delegation decision process
- 2025 context → why this decision is urgent now

**Test:** Can you state core question in one sentence without "and"?
✅ YES: "How do you decide what to delegate to AI?"

**Post 1 answered ONE question:**
"How does AI change your thinking even when you're not using it?"

**Post 2 now matches this focus.**

## Time & Source Realism

### Original Plan:

**Time estimate:** 20-27 hours focused research
**Expected sources:** 85-120 sources → narrow to 40-60 citations
**Research complexity:** 30 tasks across 7 phases

**Reality check:** This is academic paper scope, not blog post.

### Revised Plan:

**Time estimate:** 12-18 hours focused research
**Expected sources:** 20-30 sources → narrow to 12-18 citations
**Research complexity:** 8 focused tasks

**Comparison to Post 1:**
- Post 1 length: ~4,500 words
- Post 1 citations: ~15-20 strategic citations (estimated from draft)
- Post 1 research time: Likely 6-8 hours maximum

**Post 2 revised plan:**
- Target length: 4,500-5,000 words (slightly longer, more complex topic)
- Citations: 12-18 (matches Post 1 density)
- Research time: 12-18 hours (more complex but manageable)

**Why more time than Post 1:**
- Organizational examples harder to find than psychology studies
- Need verified case studies (Post 1 used more published research)
- Comparison table requires evidence across multiple dimensions
- Opening hook must be dramatic AND verifiable

**But still blog post scope, not dissertation.**

## Added Elements (Engineering Success)

### New Task 7: 2025 AI Developments Context

**Why added:**
- Original plan mentioned 2025 but didn't systematically establish urgency
- Post 1 succeeded with strong 2025 framing throughout
- Need explicit task: "What changed in 2025 that makes this matter NOW?"

**Expected output:**
- 2-3 major 2025 AI capability developments
- Organizational pilot programs and failures from 2024-2025
- Industry reports showing delegation becoming urgent issue
- Creates "why now?" framing for entire post

**Time: 1-2 hours**

---

### New Task 8: Surprise Factor Research

**Why added:**
- Post 1 power came from counterintuitive findings
- Original plan produced predictable conclusions
- Need explicit hunt for "wait, WHAT?" moments

**Expected output:**
- 3-5 counterintuitive findings that challenge common beliefs
- "Everyone thinks X, research shows Y" patterns
- Surprising success stories (companies doing OPPOSITE of best practices?)
- Unexpected failure patterns

**This task has permission to find ANYTHING surprising—no pre-specified answer.**

**Time: 1-2 hours**
