## Time-Boxing and Pivots

### If Research Comes Up Short:

**Scenario 1: No compelling hook after 3 hours**
→ PIVOT to statistical hook (Task 0.2)

**Scenario 2: Framework validation weak**
→ LABEL explicitly as synthesis, not proven method

**Scenario 3: Domain example data incomplete**
→ REDUCE to 3 strong examples vs 5 weak ones

**Scenario 4: Behind schedule at Week 1 checkpoint**
→ REASSESS scope, consider narrowing to HITL-only post

### Research Flexibility:
- Some rabbit holes are valuable (follow if promising)
- Most rabbit holes waste time (stay disciplined)
- Time-box everything, reassess hourly
- Quality over quantity (better 30 strong citations than 60 weak)

---

## Post-Research Deliverables

### Research Synthesis Document:
- All citations in organized bibliography
- Key findings by section (Act I, II, III, IV)
- Gaps and limitations identified
- Examples with full supporting data
- Framework validation status

### Writing Preparation:
- Opening hook finalized
- 5 domain examples ready
- Citation list for each major claim
