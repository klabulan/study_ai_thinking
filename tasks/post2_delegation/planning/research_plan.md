## Cross-Cutting Research Needs

### Critical Throughout All Phases

**Source Quality Standards:**
- **Tier 1 (prefer):** Peer-reviewed academic journals, conference proceedings
- **Tier 2 (acceptable):** Respected industry research (MIT, Stanford, McKinsey)
- **Tier 3 (use sparingly):** Verified journalism, company case studies with evidence
- **Never:** Blogs without citations, marketing materials, unverified claims

**Citation Requirements:**
- Every factual claim needs a source
- Statistics need original research citation (not secondary reporting)
- Case studies need verification (published paper, official report, or detailed journalism)
- No invented examples, no "studies show" without naming the study

**Recency Priority:**
- 2023-2025 studies strongly preferred (AI landscape changes rapidly)
- 2020-2022 acceptable if still relevant
- Pre-2020: only for foundational concepts or timeless principles

**Domain Diversity:**
- Need examples from multiple domains (medical, legal, software, business)
- Avoid over-indexing on any single industry
- Show patterns across contexts
