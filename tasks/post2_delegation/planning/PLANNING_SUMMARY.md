# Planning Summary: AI Delegation Post

**Status:** ✅ Planning Complete, Ready for Research Phase
**Date:** 2025-10-12
**Content Type:** Blog post (Part 2 of AI Trust Gap Series)

---

## Planning Process Completed

### 1. Preliminary Plan ✅
**File:** `preliminary_plan.md`
**Created:** Initial post structure with full scope
**Key Elements:**
- Comprehensive narrative arc (4 acts)
- Multiple themes (HITL, AI vs humans, task qualification, team management)
- Framework proposals
- Research gap identification

**Assessment:** Ambitious but overly broad (C+ rating)

---

### 2. Research Plan ✅
**File:** `research_plan.md`
**Created:** 7-phase comprehensive research strategy
**Coverage:**
- Phase 1: HITL effectiveness (15-20 sources)
- Phase 2: AI vs human comparison (20-25 sources)
- Phase 3: Task qualification (10-15 sources)
- Phase 4: Team management (12-18 sources)
- Phase 5: Accountability (10-15 sources)
- Phase 6: Case studies (10-15 sources)
- Phase 7: Management theory (8-12 sources)

**Total:** 85-120 sources projected, 20-27 hours estimated

**Assessment:** Thorough but time estimate unrealistic (B rating)

---

### 3. Self-Critique ✅
**File:** `plan_critique.md`
**Created:** Honest assessment of weaknesses
**Key Findings:**
- **Scope creep:** Trying to cover too many themes
- **Weak hook strategy:** Hope-based, not research-validated
- **Framework not validated:** Invented vs evidence-derived
- **Time underestimated:** 35-45 hours realistic
- **Unclear audience:** Engineers? Managers? Both?
- **Practical outcome less concrete** than post 1

**Critical Insights:**
- Need 40% scope reduction
- Hook-first research required
- Framework must be validated or clearly labeled
- Prioritization essential

---

### 4. Final Plan ✅
**File:** `final_plan.md`
**Created:** Revised, focused post structure

**Major Changes:**

#### SCOPE REDUCED to 2 Core Themes:
1. **Why HITL Works But Isn't Enough** (effectiveness + limitations)
2. **The Delegation Decision Framework** (practical decision tree)

#### CUT from Scope:
- Comprehensive AI vs human comparison (separate post)
- Team management deep-dives (too broad)
- Accountability frameworks (too abstract)
- Multiple framework proposals (focus on ONE)

#### NEW Strategies:
- **Hook-first research:** Validate within 5 hours or pivot
- **Backup hooks:** Statistical opening, composite case study
- **Clear audience:** Engineering/product managers, team leads
- **Concrete outcome:** 3-question delegation decision tree
- **Realistic length:** 4,500-5,000 words

#### Post Structure (Revised):
- **Act I:** The Paradox (800 words) - Hook + setup
- **Act II:** Why HITL Works (1,500 words) - Evidence
- **Act III:** Delegation Framework (1,800 words) - Practical tool
- **Act IV:** Making It Real (400 words) - Implementation

---

### 5. Final Research Tasks ✅
**File:** `final_research_tasks.md`
**Created:** Prioritized, actionable research roadmap

**Structure:**
- **Phase 0:** Hook validation (5 hours) - CRITICAL PATH
- **Phase 1:** HITL evidence (8 hours) - Priority 0
- **Phase 2:** AI capability boundaries (6 hours) - Priority 0
- **Phase 3:** Framework validation (4 hours) - Priority 0
- **Phase 4:** Domain examples (5 hours) - Priority 0
- **Phase 5:** Supporting concepts (4 hours) - Priority 1
- **Phase 6:** Theoretical grounding (3 hours) - Priority 2

**Total Time:** 25-35 hours (realistic estimate)

**Key Features:**
- Time-boxed tasks
- Decision points at 5hr, 15hr, 30hr marks
- Backup strategies for each phase
- Source quality standards explicit
- Research output format defined

---

## Key Decisions Made

### Strategic Choices:

**1. Narrow Focus**
- From 5 themes → 2 themes (HITL + delegation decisions)
- Enables depth over breadth
- Aligns with 4,500-5,000 word target

**2. Hook-First Approach**
- Research opening case study BEFORE committing to structure
- 5-hour time box, then pivot to backup if needed
- Prevents hope-based planning

**3. Framework Validation Required**
- Find organizations using similar frameworks
- OR label explicitly as synthesis/proposal
- No invented frameworks presented as proven

**4. Clear Target Audience**
- PRIMARY: Engineering/product managers, team leads
- People making delegation decisions daily
- Need practical frameworks, not theory

**5. Concrete Practical Outcome**
- 3-question decision tree
- Risk-verification-capability matrix
- 5 domain-specific examples
- "Starting Monday" implementation guide

---

## What Makes This Different from Post 1

### Similarities (Maintained):
- Evidence-first approach
- Surprising opening
- Frameworks emerging from research
- Honest about limitations
- Practical takeaway

### Differences (Adjusted):
- **Audience:** Individual users → Team/organizational level
- **Focus:** Cognitive bias → Process/delegation decisions
- **Outcome:** Behavioral protocol → Decision framework
- **Examples:** Personal interaction → Organizational deployment

---

## Success Criteria

### Post Succeeds When:
- [ ] Manager recognizes their delegation challenges
- [ ] Three-question framework immediately applicable
- [ ] Every claim has citation
- [ ] 5 domain examples resonate
- [ ] Measurable: Can evaluate real delegation decision
- [ ] Engagement: "Framework helped me decide" comments

### Post Fails If:
- Too abstract (can't apply Monday)
- Too broad (tries to cover everything)
- Unsourced claims
- Framework feels invented
- Examples don't resonate

---

## Research Execution Plan

### Timeline:
**Week 1:** Hook + Core Evidence (Phases 0-2)
- Days 1-2: Hook validation → DECISION POINT
- Days 3-4: HITL evidence
- Day 5: AI capabilities
- **Checkpoint:** Enough for Acts I-II?

**Week 2:** Framework + Examples (Phases 3-4)
- Days 1-2: Framework validation
- Days 3-4: Domain examples
- Day 5: Supporting concepts
- **Checkpoint:** Framework validated?

**Week 3:** Gaps + Polish (Phase 5-6 + synthesis)
- Days 1-2: Fill gaps
- Day 3: Theory if needed
- Days 4-5: Organize, synthesize

### Decision Points:
- **5 hours:** Hook locked or pivoted
- **15 hours:** Scope adjustment if needed
- **30 hours:** Final gap assessment

---

## Critical Path Items

### MUST COMPLETE FIRST:
1. **Hook validation** (Phase 0, Task 0.1) - 3 hours
   - Compelling case study found → proceed
   - Not found → pivot to statistical hook

2. **HITL success cases** (Phase 1, Tasks 1.1-1.2) - 4 hours
   - Need 3-5 cases with metrics
   - Foundation for Act II

3. **Framework validation** (Phase 3, Task 3.1) - 2 hours
   - Find organizations using similar approach
   - Or prepare to label as synthesis

### CAN PARALLELIZE:
- AI capability research (Phase 2)
- Domain examples (Phase 4)
- Supporting concepts (Phase 5)

## Rationale Summary

### Why These Decisions:

**Narrowed Scope:**
- 4,500 words cannot adequately cover 5 complex themes
- Post 1 succeeded with focused scope
- Depth over breadth resonates better

**Hook-First Research:**
- Prevents building plan around non-existent story
- Real constraint: Verified AI delegation failures are rare
- Backup strategies ensure resilience

**Framework Validation:**
- Post 1 succeeded because framework emerged from research
- Can't repeat with invented framework
- Must find evidence or label clearly

**Realistic Time Estimates:**
- Initial 20-27 hour estimate was fantasy
- 25-35 hours accounts for:
  - Case study hunting (time-consuming)
  - Source quality verification
  - Multi-domain examples
  - Synthesis and organization

**Prioritization:**
- Not all research equally important
- P0 tasks enable post to exist
- P1-P2 improve quality but aren't blockers
- Time-boxing prevents perfectionism

## Risk Assessment

### Risks and Mitigations:

**Risk 1: Compelling Hook Not Found**
- Mitigation: Backup statistical opening ready (Task 0.2)
- Mitigation: Composite case study option (clearly labeled)

**Risk 2: Framework Lacks Validation**
- Mitigation: Label as synthesis, not proven method
- Mitigation: Ground in emerging organizational practices

**Risk 3: Research Takes Longer Than 35 Hours**
- Mitigation: Decision points enable scope adjustment
- Mitigation: P2 tasks skippable if behind schedule

**Risk 4: Examples Don't Resonate with Audience**
- Mitigation: 5 diverse domain examples
- Mitigation: Target audience clearly defined (eng/product managers)

**Risk 5: Post Less Impactful Than Post 1**
- Mitigation: Honest expectation setting
- Mitigation: Post 1 had exceptional research (hard to replicate)
- Mitigation: Different success criteria (framework utility vs protocol efficacy)
