## Context Files to Read (MANDATORY)

**Primary source:**
1. `papers/blog1/post2_delegation/DRAFT_v3_HITL_FOCUS_RU.md` - Russian version to translate

**Voice reference:**
2. `papers/blog1/post1_bias/DRAFT_v3_EN.md` - Post 1 English for voice consistency

**Project standards:**
4. `CLAUDE.md` - Quality standards
5. `.claude/agents/content-writer.md` - Your role (blog section)

---

## Task: Translate and Adapt DRAFT_v3_HITL_FOCUS_RU.md to English

### Your Mission

Create a **native English blog post** from the Russian source.

This is NOT literal translation. This is **cultural and linguistic adaptation** maintaining:
- Technical accuracy (100%)
- Voice warmth (100%)
- Source citations (100% unchanged)
- Narrative structure (preserved)
- English reading patterns (adapted)

---

## Translation + Adaptation Guidelines

### Philosophy: Meaning Over Words

**Translate:**
- The meaning, insight, and impact
- The warmth and peer-to-peer connection
- The technical precision
- The narrative flow

**Do NOT translate:**
- Word-by-word literally
- Russian sentence patterns to English
- Idioms literally
- Cultural references without adaptation check

---

## What Changes (Adaptation Required)

### 1. Sentence Structure

**Russian pattern:**
```
Длинные предложения с множественными подчинениями работают естественно.
Сложные конструкции читаются плавно.
```

**English pattern:**
```
Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy statements with detailed explanations.
Keep readers engaged through rhythm variation.
```

**Example transformation:**
- Russian: "Когда вы ставите задачу сотруднику, вы проверяете его квалификацию (резюме, интервью, рекомендации), вы понимаете уровень риска и выбираете уровень контроля..."
- English: "When you delegate to an employee, you check their qualifications. Resume, interview, references. You assess the risk level and choose appropriate oversight..."

### 2. Paragraph Rhythm

**Russian:** Can sustain longer paragraphs (8-10 sentences)
**English:** Prefer frequent breaks (4-6 sentences) for readability

**Action:** Break longer Russian paragraphs when adapting to English

### 3. Transition Markers

**Russian → English equivalents:**
- "Представьте:" → "Picture this:"
- "Окей" → "Here's the thing:" or "Now"
- "Вот что стоит понять:" → "What matters:" or "Here's what's critical:"
- "И вот тут начинается магия..." → "This is where it gets interesting..."
- "Собственно, к чему я это..." → "Why this matters:"
- "Но есть нюанс..." → "But here's the twist:"
- "Знакомо?" → "Sound familiar?"

### 4. Engagement Patterns

**Russian directness:**
```
Проблема Лемкина была не в недостатке экспертизы.
```

**English engagement:**
```
Lemkin's problem wasn't lack of expertise. That's not what went wrong.
```

**Add:** Engagement markers, rhetorical questions, anticipatory phrases

### 5. Cultural References

**Keep (already international):**
- Intesa Sanpaolo (Italian bank, global presence)
- Jason Lemkin / Replit (US, but tech-famous globally)
- McDonald's, Air Canada (international brands)
- Fortune, Nature, McKinsey (global publications)

**Verify if adjusting:**
- Any Russian-specific idioms → English equivalents
- Any regional tech references → ensure global recognition

---

## What Stays EXACTLY the Same

### 1. Statistics (Zero Tolerance for Changes)

**Every number must be identical:**
- 78% organizations using AI
- 21% redesigned workflows
- 463,094 women in PRAIM study
- 17.6% more cancer detection
- $3.20 return per dollar
- 73% contract review time reduction
- 79.7% → 19.8% automation bias
- 80% Stream automation
- 2,510 McNuggets (McDonald's failure)
- $1,630 Air Canada lawsuit
- 75% legal AI hallucination rate
- $67.4B business losses
- 95% accuracy requirements
- ALL other statistics

**Verification required:** Check every number against Russian source

### 2. Technical Definitions

**HITL (Human-in-the-Loop):**
- Definition unchanged
- Explanation structure preserved
- Examples identical

**HOTL (Human-on-the-Loop):**
- Definition unchanged
- Distinction from HITL clear
- Examples identical

**HFTL (Human-from-the-Loop):**
- Definition unchanged
- Risk profile preserved
- Examples identical

### 3. Decision Framework (3 Questions)

**Must preserve exactly:**
1. Видит ли результат клиент напрямую? → Does the client see the result directly?
2. Может ли ошибка причинить финансовый или юридический ущерб? → Can an error cause financial or legal harm?
3. Задача рутинная и полностью предсказуемая? → Is the task routine and fully predictable after testing?

**Logic flow identical:** Same decision tree, same examples

### 4. All 18 Citations

**Sources (already English):**
- Fortune 2025 (Lemkin/Replit)
- Nature Medicine 2025 (PRAIM study)
- Business Wire 2025 (contract analysis)
- Radiology 2023 (automation bias)
- Human Factors 2010 (Parasuraman)
- JAMA 2024 (GPT-4 medical)
- Nature Human Behaviour 2024 (meta-analysis)
- McKinsey 2024 & 2025 (multiple)
- Google Cloud 2024 & 2025 (Stacks, Stream)
- CNBC 2024 (McDonald's)
- CBC 2024 (Air Canada)
- Stanford Law 2024 (legal hallucinations)
- Ponemon 2024 (cost study)
- EU AI Act 2024
- Anthropic 2024 (computer use)

**Action:** Copy URLs exactly as-is, verify all links working

### 5. Structure

**Keep exact structure:**
- Opening: Lemkin/Replit catastrophe (July 2025)
- Why Now: 5 converging trends
- Management Baseline: What transfers from people → AI
- Three Methods: HITL, HOTL, HFTL (with success/failure examples)
- Decision Framework: 3 questions with decision tree
- Conclusion: Three questions before delegating

## Writing Process

### Step 1: Read Source + Voice Reference (30 minutes)

1. **Read Russian source completely:**
   - `papers/blog1/post2_delegation/DRAFT_v3_HITL_FOCUS_RU.md`
   - Understand narrative arc
   - Note transition points
   - Identify key examples

2. **Read Post 1 English for voice:**
   - `papers/blog1/post1_bias/DRAFT_v3_EN.md`
   - Absorb tone and rhythm
   - Note engagement patterns
   - Understand Dr. Elena voice in English

3. **Review series context:**
   - `papers/blog1/SERIES_OVERVIEW.md`
   - Series positioning (Part 2 of 3)
   - Connection to Part 1 (bias) and Part 3 (shadow AI)

### Step 2: Translate Section by Section (90 minutes)

**For each section:**

1. **Read Russian section completely** (understand full meaning)

2. **Identify key insights:**
   - What's the main point?

   - Start with meaning (not words)
   - Use English sentence patterns
   - Adapt transitions naturally
   - Maintain warmth and engagement
   - Keep statistics exact
   - Preserve citations

4. **Self-check:**
   - Would native English speaker write this way?
   - Does it match Post 1 English voice?
   - Are statistics unchanged?
   - Are examples clear for international audience?

**Section order:**
1. Opening (Lemkin/Replit) - high-impact hook
2. Why Now (5 trends) - urgency establishment
3. Management Baseline - foundation
4. HITL method - detailed with examples
5. HOTL method - detailed with examples
6. HFTL method - detailed with examples
7. Decision Framework - 3 questions
8. Conclusion - actionable summary

### Step 3: Adaptation Polish (30 minutes)

**Read full draft aloud (mentally or actually):**
- Does rhythm feel natural in English?
- Are transitions smooth?
- Do idioms work?
- Is voice consistent throughout?

**Polish for English patterns:**
- Vary sentence length deliberately
- Add engagement markers where natural
- Break longer paragraphs if needed
- Ensure transitions feel native

**Verify technical accuracy:**
- Every statistic matches Russian
- All citations preserved
- HITL/HOTL/HFTL definitions accurate
- Decision framework logic identical

### Step 4: Create Translation Notes (10 minutes)

**Document adaptation decisions:**

Create `tasks/post2-english-adaptation/translation-notes.md`:
