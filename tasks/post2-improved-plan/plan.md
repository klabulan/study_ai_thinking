## Content Type: Blog Post

---

## Scope Calibration Check ✅

**Reference metrics:** (from /.claude/reference/content-scoping-guide.md - Blog Post Success Formula)
- Tasks: 6-8 tasks
- Time: 12-18 hours
- Citations: 12-20 (rigorously selected)
- Recency: 75-80% from last 18 months

**Original research plan (FINAL_RESEARCH_PLAN.md):**
- Tasks: 8 tasks
- Time: 12-18 hours estimate
- Citations: 20-30 sources → 12-18 final citations planned
- Recency: 75%+ 2024-2025 focus

**This plan (post improvement):**
- Tasks: 3 tasks (analysis + improved plan + review)
- Time: 6-8 hours
- Deliverables: 1 improved comprehensive post plan

**Ratio:** Planning phase only (0.4, 0.4, N/A)

**Assessment:** ✅ Calibrated - This is a planning refinement task, not full content creation. Research already completed (8 tasks, ~15 hours). Now integrating findings into improved post structure.

**Justification:** Research phase complete with excellent findings. This task synthesizes research into actionable post plan that main agent will use to direct content-writer for actual blog post creation.

## Context

**Project:** AI Presentation Repository - Blog Post Series
**Location:** papers/blog1/post2_delegation/
**Current Status:** 8 research tasks completed, initial post plan exists
**Task:** Improve post plan based on completed research findings

**Existing Materials:**
- FINAL_POST_PLAN.md - Original 700-line plan
- FINAL_RESEARCH_PLAN.md - Research methodology
- task1-8_summary.md files - 8 completed research summaries
- papers/blog1/post1_bias/ - Reference for style/structure (1,168 words, Nature paper based)

**Key Insight from Research:** The research revealed 5 major "WAIT, WHAT?" findings that significantly strengthen the post's thesis. The improved plan should leverage these counterintuitive insights.

## Execution Steps for Main Agent

### Step 1: Analyze Research Findings & Identify Improvements
**Agent:** Main agent (no specialist needed - analysis task)
**Duration:** 2 hours

**Main agent should:**
1. TodoWrite: Mark "Analyze research findings" as in_progress
2. Read all 8 research summary files (task1-8_summary.md)
3. Read original FINAL_POST_PLAN.md
4. Read post1_bias/README.md for style reference
5. Identify key improvements:
   - Which research findings strengthen the original thesis?
   - Which findings suggest structural changes?
   - Are there gaps between research and original plan?
   - What counterintuitive insights create engagement?
6. Write: tasks/post2-improved-plan/research-integration-analysis.md
   - Document gaps found
   - List key research findings to emphasize
   - Recommend structural improvements
   - Note style/voice considerations
7. TodoWrite: Mark as completed

**Success Criteria:**
- All 8 research summaries reviewed
- Clear gap analysis documented
- Specific improvement recommendations identified
- Analysis file created with actionable insights

### Step 2: Create Improved Post Plan
**Agent:** Main agent (no specialist needed - planning task)
**Duration:** 3-4 hours

**Main agent should:**
1. TodoWrite: Mark "Create improved post plan" as in_progress
2. Read: tasks/post2-improved-plan/research-integration-analysis.md
3. Review: Original FINAL_POST_PLAN.md structure
4. Create: IMPROVED_POST_PLAN.md with following sections:

   **Required Sections:**
   - Executive Summary (what changed, why)
   - Core Thesis (refined based on research)
   - Opening Hook (Replit case integration)
   - Four-Act Structure:
     * Act I: The Paradox (800-1,000 words)
     * Act II: The Problem Space (1,800-2,000 words)
       - HITL Reality Check section
       - Comparison Table section (5 dimensions)
       - Deep dives on 3 key dimensions

       - Three-Stage Framework
     * Act IV: Conclusion (500-600 words)

   **Integration of 5 Counterintuitive Findings:**
   - Finding #1: Human-AI worse than AI alone (g=-0.23)
   - Finding #2: Delegation increases dishonesty 17.6x
   - Finding #3: Only 21% redesign workflows
   - Finding #4: Reliable AI creates worse automation bias
   - Finding #5: Success rates collapse with variations (50%→25%)

   **Evidence Mapping:**
   - Map each major claim to specific research citations
   - Specify which task summary provides evidence
   - Note page/section references for easy lookup

   **Style Consistency Check:**
   - Match post1_bias voice and tone
   - Maintain 4,500-5,000 word target
   - Ensure 2024-2025 research focus
   - Include "why now?" urgency framing

4. Write: tasks/post2-improved-plan/IMPROVED_POST_PLAN.md
5. TodoWrite: Mark as completed

**Success Criteria:**
- Complete improved plan created
- All 5 counterintuitive findings integrated
- Research evidence mapped to sections
- Style consistent with post1_bias
- 4,500-5,000 word structure maintained
- Ready for content-writer to use

## Key Principles for This Task

**From Research Analysis:**
1. **Surprise Engineering:** 5 counterintuitive findings are the strongest content
2. **Evidence Density:** 47+ sources from Task 4, 60+ from Task 3, 30+ from Task 2
3. **2025 Urgency:** Task 7 provides "why now" framing (78% adoption, 56.4% incident jump, EU AI Act)
4. **Framework Validation:** Task 5 proves three-stage framework with 70-90% cost reduction evidence
5. **Opening Hook Power:** Task 1 Replit case is perfect (July 2025, 1,200+ people affected, dramatic)

**From post1_bias Reference:**
- Length: 1,168 words (post1) → aim for 4,500-5,000 (post2 covers organizational complexity)
- Voice: Warm, research-backed, practical (Dr. Elena Cognitive)
- Structure: Hook → Evidence → Framework → Honest conclusion
- Style: "Exploring together" not "here's what you should do"
- Citations: Every claim backed, sources traceable

**Critical Success Factor:**
The improved plan must make it EASY for content-writer to create excellent post by:
- Clear section structure with word counts
- Specific research evidence mapped to each section
- Counterintuitive findings distributed for engagement
- Voice/tone guidance clear
- Quality criteria measurable
