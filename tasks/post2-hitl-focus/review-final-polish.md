# Final Polish Review: Language, Storytelling, Natural Flow

## Review Context

**File:** `papers/blog1/post2_delegation/DRAFT_v3_HITL_FOCUS_RU.md`
**Review type:** Final polish - Language naturalization + storytelling + flow
**Focus areas:**
1. Remove English words (это русский блог!)
2. Check storytelling and speech going
3. Verify naturality (звучит как живой блог?)
4. Minor improvements where needed

## Critical Review Dimensions

### 1. English Words Purge

**Check every English word/phrase:**
- Technical terms that have Russian equivalents
- Anglicisms that sound unnatural
- English phrases in Russian text
- Code-switch that breaks flow

**Keep English ONLY if:**
- Industry standard term (HITL, HOTL, HFTL - these stay)
- No natural Russian equivalent
- Russian tech audience expects it (API, email, etc.)

**Examples to check:**
- "real-time" → реальном времени? в реальном времени?
- "customer-facing" → клиентский? customer-facing?
- "bottleneck" → узкое место ✓
- "overhead" → накладные расходы?
- "deployment" → внедрение? развёртывание?
- "review" → проверка ✓
- "output" → результат?
- "sample" → выборка?

### 2. Storytelling & Narrative Arc

**Check narrative structure:**
- Does opening hook pull reader in?
- Do transitions between sections flow naturally?
- Is there momentum building through post?
- Does conclusion circle back satisfyingly?

**Specific checks:**
- Lines 22-32: Lemkin hook compelling?
- Lines 84-86: Transition to three methods smooth?
- Lines 174-176: Framework intro engaging?
- Lines 262-287: Conclusion powerful?

**Look for:**
- Jarring topic shifts
- Missing connective tissue
- Lost narrative thread
- Weak section endings

### 3. Speech Going (Речевой Ритм)

**Read aloud test:**
- Does it sound like natural speech?
- Are sentences too long/complex?
- Is rhythm varied (short + long sentences)?
- Are there tongue-twisters?

**Check for:**
- Walls of text (>200 words)
- Monotonous sentence length
- Overuse of passive voice
- Academic stuffiness

### 4. Naturality (Живость Языка)

**Russian blog voice checks:**
- Conversational markers present? ("вот в чём дело", "представьте себе")
- Direct address to reader? ("вы", "ваш")
- Rhetorical questions?
- Appropriate informality?

**Compare to post1_bias style:**
- Warmth maintained?
- Dr. Elena voice consistent?
- Confidence-building tone?
