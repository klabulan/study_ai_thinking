### Source 5: Kahneman, "Thinking, Fast and Slow", 2011

**Type:** Book (foundational cognitive science)
**Referenced in blog:** System 1 (fast, automatic, unconscious) vs. System 2 (slow, conscious, logical)

**Reason for inclusion:**
- **THEORETICAL FOUNDATION** - Establishes cognitive mechanisms underlying bias susceptibility
- Nobel Prize-winning research - ultimate academic credibility
- Explains WHY awareness alone doesn't prevent bias (System 1 operates unconsciously)
- Provides cognitive framework for understanding bias inheritance mechanism
- Necessary for scholarly grounding of thesis

**Key evidence to cite:**
- Dual-system theory: System 1 (automatic, unconscious) vs. System 2 (conscious, controlled)
- Cognitive biases operate at System 1 level (below conscious awareness)
- Explains why metacognitive awareness ≠ behavioral change

## Sources Excluded (with rationale)

### Tversky & Kahneman (1974) - Anchoring foundational study
**Reason for exclusion:** Kahneman 2011 book already provides cognitive framework. Adding original 1974 anchoring paper would be redundant for thesis length constraints. Blog uses this for historical depth, but thesis needs efficiency.

### Chartrand & Bargh (1999) - Social learning and mimicry
**Reason for exclusion:** While relevant to bias inheritance mechanism (social learning), we already have Glickman & Sharot 2024 as direct evidence. Chartrand adds supporting depth but not essential for condensed thesis. Space better used for application studies.

### CFA Institute Claude prompt leak analysis (2025)
**Reason for exclusion:** While fascinating (shows AI designed to "suppress contradiction," "amplify fluency"), this is industry analysis not peer-reviewed research. RINC thesis needs academic sources. Evidence is compelling but not suitable for formal academic citation.

### MIT verification systems research (2024)
**Reason for exclusion:** Blog cites this for practical validation solutions. Thesis focuses on problem and mechanism, not technical solutions. Out of scope for theoretical bionics framing.

### SAGE Journals awareness study (2025)
**Reason for exclusion:** Shows awareness alone produces only 6.9% bias reduction. Supports "awareness doesn't work" argument but adds marginal value when we already have multiple studies showing same pattern. Can be referenced indirectly without formal citation.

### Psychology AI triage study (2024)
**Reason for exclusion:** Demonstrates confirmation bias amplification (trust AI 34% more when agrees, only 42% when disagrees). Strong evidence but we already have medical (Goh) and management anchoring studies. Three application studies would be redundant for thesis constraints.

### GitHub Copilot developer study (1200 developers)
**Reason for exclusion:** Excellent narrative example (developers unconsciously adopted Copilot's terse commenting style) but appears to be survey data not formal peer-reviewed study. Cannot verify academic source from blog text. Better for popular science than thesis.

### Evidence Flow
1. **Введение:** Cite Glickman & Sharot [1] and Gerlich [2] to establish problem
2. **Методы и материалы:** Reference Kahneman [5] for theoretical framework, then Goh [3] and Management [4] for empirical evidence

## Total Character Budget for Citations

### Calculation

**RINC requirement:** Each citation adds ~150-200 characters to Список источников

**Selected sources:** 5 sources

**Character estimates per citation:**
- [1] Glickman & Sharot (Nature HB): ~180 chars
- [2] Gerlich (Societies): ~170 chars
- [3] Goh et al. (Comm Medicine): ~190 chars
- [4] Management study: ~180 chars
- [5] Kahneman book: ~140 chars

**Total citations section:** 5 × 175 avg = **875 characters**

### Available Space for Main Text

**RINC requirements:**
- Total minimum: 2500 characters (can go to ~3500 for full 2 pages)
- Target: 3000 characters (comfortable fit in 1.5-2 pages)

**Budget breakdown:**
- **Annotation:** 600 characters (required ~600)
- **Keywords:** 100 characters (5-7 keywords)
- **Citations:** 875 characters (5 sources)
- **Metadata overhead (УДК, title, authors):** ~300 characters

**Subtotal metadata:** 1875 characters

**Available for main text:** 3000 - 1875 = **1125 characters**

### Main Text Allocation

With 1125 characters for Введение + Методы/Результаты + Заключение:

- **Введение:** 350-400 characters (31-35%)
- **Методы и материалы; результаты:** 500-550 characters (44-49%)
- **Заключение:** 200-250 characters (18-22%)

**Note:** This is VERY tight. Will require extreme condensation. May need to target 3500 character total (full 2 pages) to get ~1600 characters for main text:

**Alternative allocation (3500 char total):**
- Metadata: 1875 chars (same)
- Main text: **1625 chars available**
  - Введение: 500 chars (31%)
  - Методы и материалы; результаты: 800 chars (49%)
  - Заключение: 325 chars (20%)

**Recommendation:** Target 3500 characters total (2 full pages) for adequate depth.

## Next Steps for Thesis Writing

1. **Step 2 (Metadata):** Use УДК code from bionics_positioning.md
2. **Step 3 (Writing):** Strict character discipline - every word must carry information
3. **Condensation priority:**
   - NO narrative elements
   - NO rhetorical questions
   - Statistics without context stories
   - Mechanisms described in 1-2 sentences each
   - Practices listed with percentages only

**Quality check:** Every sentence must be traceable to one of these 5 sources. No unsourced claims.
