# Task: Adapt Blog Post to Bionics-2025 Conference Thesis

## Content Type: Academic Conference Thesis (RINC-indexed)

---

## Scope Calibration Check ✅

**Reference metrics:** Academic paper (no baseline yet for thesis adaptation)
- Tasks: N/A (first thesis adaptation)
- Time: 8-12 hours estimated (condensation + academic reformatting)
- Citations/Deliverables: 1 thesis (1.5-2 pages), 3-6 citations minimum

**This plan:**
- Tasks: 6 tasks
- Time: 9-11 hours
- Citations/Deliverables: 1 thesis, 4-6 citations (selected from blog's 20+ sources)

**Ratio:** N/A (establishing baseline for future thesis work)
**Assessment:** Calibrated for thesis adaptation scope

**Justification:**
- Thesis is condensation task (4500 words → ~1500 words), not new research
- Blog post already has extensive verified sources (need selection, not collection)
- Academic formatting adds overhead (УДК, structured sections, RINC requirements)
- Bionics connection requires careful argumentation (human-AI cognitive interaction as bionic topic)
- Quality-critical: First submission to academic conference

---

## Context

### Project Background
- **Repository:** AI Presentation materials for Russian tech audience
- **Source content:** Blog post about AI bias inheritance and critical thinking degradation
- **Quality:** Extensively researched (20+ peer-reviewed sources, published 2024-2025)
- **Voice:** Popular science (needs translation to academic voice)

### Conference Context
- **Conference:** "Бионика-2025" - 5th International Scientific-Practical Conference
- **Venue:** МГТУ им. Н.Э. Баумана, Moscow
- **Dates:** October 29-31, 2025
- **Deadline:** October 1, 2025
- **Format:** Hybrid (in-person + remote)
- **Indexing:** RINC (Russian Index of Scientific Citation)

### Target Sections (Potential Fit)
1. **Section #1: Theoretical Bionics (Biocybernetics)**
   - Biocybernetics: Study of control and communication in biological systems
   - Fit: Human-AI cognitive interaction as biocybernetic system
   - Angle: Feedback loops in human-AI cognition (bias inheritance as cybernetic failure)

2. **Section #4: Humanitarian Bionics (Psychology, Sociology)**
   - Psychology: Cognitive processes in human-AI interaction
   - Fit: Applying bionic methods to study AI-induced cognitive changes
   - Angle: Human cognitive system adapting to AI interaction patterns

**Recommended Section:** #1 (Biocybernetics) - stronger theoretical foundation

## Key Challenges

### 1. Content Condensation
**Challenge:** 4500-word blog post → 1.5-2 pages (2500-3500 characters)
**Strategy:**
- Focus on core research findings (Glickman & Sharot, Gerlich, mechanisms)
- Eliminate narrative elements (storytelling, rhetorical questions)
- Condense framework to essential elements (3 mechanisms, 4 practices)

### 2. Voice Translation
**Challenge:** Popular science → academic style
**Strategy:**
- Replace "Вот в чём штука" → "Установлено, что"
- Remove rhetorical questions ("Знакомо?")
- Convert examples to research descriptions
- Maintain Russian academic conventions

### 3. Bionics Connection
**Challenge:** Establish AI bias inheritance as bionic/biocybernetic topic
**Strategy:**
- Frame as biocybernetic feedback system (human ↔ AI information flow)
- Emphasize cognitive system adaptation (human brain learning from AI patterns)
- Position structural practices as bio-inspired control mechanisms
- Use cybernetic terminology (feedback loops, system calibration, control mechanisms)

### 4. RINC Formatting Requirements
**Challenge:** Strict structural and citation requirements
**Strategy:**
- Follow template precisely (УДК → Список источников)
- Annotation ~600 characters ("Рассмотрено..., показано..., сделаны выводы...")
- 5-7 keywords (no abbreviations except standard)
- Proper citation format (English sources with DOI, Russian sources transliterated)

### 5. Source Selection
**Challenge:** Choose 4-6 most relevant sources from blog's 20+ citations
**Strategy:**
- Priority: Nature Human Behaviour (Glickman & Sharot) - flagship study
- Include: Gerlich 2025 (critical thinking correlation)
- Include: Management/medical application studies (practical validation)
- Include: Kahneman or foundational cognitive bias research (theoretical grounding)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: УДК Code Selection
**Issue:** Wrong УДК code could cause desk rejection
**Mitigation:**
- Research multiple biocybernetics papers for code examples
- Use https://www.teacode.com/online/udc/ classifier
- Verify code against similar AI-psychology papers
- Provide rationale in metadata_draft.md

### Risk 2: Bionics Connection Weak
**Issue:** Reviewers may not see clear bionic/biocybernetic relevance
**Mitigation:**
- Strong cybernetic framing in Введение (feedback loops, system adaptation)
- Explicit comparison to bio-inspired control mechanisms
- Use established biocybernetics terminology (Wiener, Ashby concepts if applicable)
- Position in Section #1 (stronger theoretical fit than Section #4)

### Risk 3: Over-Condensation
**Issue:** Losing essential research quality in condensation
**Mitigation:**
- Preserve core study details (Glickman & Sharot methods, results)
- Keep specific statistics (r = -0.68, 15-25% amplification, etc.)
- Maintain causal mechanisms (3 mechanisms intact)
- Cut narrative/rhetorical elements, not research substance

### Risk 4: Citation Format Errors
**Issue:** RINC requires specific citation styles for English/Russian sources
**Mitigation:**
- Follow example formatting exactly (DOI required for English journals)
- Verify transliteration standard (BGN) for Russian sources
- Check each citation against requirements template
- Content reviewer validates all citations in Step 4

## Notes for Main Agent

### User Input Required (After Step 6)
Main agent must inform user:

```
Thesis draft complete. User action required:

1. Author Information (complete template in thesis):
   - Full name (Фамилия Имя Отчество)
   - Email address
   - Organization affiliation (full name)
   - City, country
   - SPIN-код (if available)
   - Mark corresponding author with (*)

2. Obtain "Заключение о возможности открытого опубликования"
   - Required document from your organization
   - Confirms permission for public publication

3. Review and confirm УДК code selection
   - Code: [will be in metadata_draft.md]
   - Rationale: [in same file]

4. Submit to conference:
   - Primary: https://rusengineer.bmstu.ru/
   - Also register: http://biomimetic.wixsite.com/conference
   - Deadline: October 1, 2025
```

### Quality Standards Reference
This is an academic submission to RINC-indexed conference. Quality bar is HIGH:
- Every claim must be traceable to cited source
- Academic voice must be rigorous, not accessible
- Russian academic conventions must be followed precisely
- RINC formatting is non-negotiable (desk rejection if violated)

### Content Type Differences
**Blog post voice:** Engaging, rhetorical, narrative-driven, accessible
**Thesis voice:** Rigorous, declarative, evidence-driven, formal

Main agent should verify content-writer successfully translates voice in Step 3.
