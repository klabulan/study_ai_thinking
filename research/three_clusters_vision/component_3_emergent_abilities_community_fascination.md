## The Core Phenomenon: What Are Emergent Abilities?

### Defining Emergence in AI

**In the context of LLMs, emergence refers to capabilities that appear suddenly and unpredictably as model size, computational power, and training data scale up**, with the topic garnering attention because of the potential for unpredictable emergence of risky capabilities [Georgetown CSET, 2024](https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/emergent-abilities-in-large-language-models-an-explainer/)

**Large language models can produce hundreds of "emergent" abilities — tasks that big models can complete that smaller models can't**, many of which seem to have little to do with analyzing text [Quanta Magazine, March 2023](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-unpredictable-abilities-emerging-from-large-ai-models-20230316/)

**These abilities range from multiplication to generating executable computer code to, apparently, decoding movies based on emojis** [Quanta Magazine]

**Emergent abilities have been a major topic of research and discussion in the AI community**, with users beginning to describe more and more emergent behaviors after the advent of models like GPT-3, which has 175 billion parameters [ArXiv Survey, 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.05788v2)

---

## The Stanford "Mirage" Challenge (2023-2024)

### The Controversial Paper

**A paper by a trio of researchers at Stanford University posits that the sudden appearance of these abilities is just a consequence of the way researchers measure the LLM's performance** [Quanta Magazine, February 2024](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-quickly-do-large-language-models-learn-unexpected-skills-20240213/)

**Their alternative explanation states that emergent abilities appear due to the researcher's choice of metric rather than due to fundamental changes in model behavior with scale**, with nonlinear or discontinuous metrics producing apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes [ArXiv, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.15004)

**The Stanford researchers point out that LLMs were judged only on accuracy: Either they could do it perfectly, or they couldn't**, so even if an LLM predicted most of the digits correctly, it failed [Quanta Magazine]

### Political and Research Community Impact

**Mirage made a splash in the research community and even resulted in the House Science Committee writing that it had caused Emergent Abilities to be "debunked by rigorous statistical analysis"** [Georgetown CSET]

**However, the debate remains unresolved, with ongoing contention regarding whether emergent abilities represent authentic phenomena or are instead reflections of measurement biases** [Georgetown CSET]

**Claims of "emergent capabilities" in LLMs have been discussed by journalists, researchers, and even members of Congress**, though these conversations have often been hampered by confusion about what the term means and what it implies [Georgetown CSET, April 2024]

## The BIG-bench Project: Systematically Testing Emergence

### Google's Community-Driven Benchmark

**In 2020, Google researchers realized the potential of LLMs and predicted that they would be transformative, so they asked the community to provide examples of tasks that were both different and difficult**, which led to the Beyond the Imitation Game Benchmark (BIG-bench) project [Quanta Magazine]

**BIG-bench (Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark) currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions** [GitHub, BIG-bench](https://github.com/google/BIG-bench)

**Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond**, focusing on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models [Deepgram, BIG-bench Guide](https://deepgram.com/learn/big-bench-llm-benchmark-guide)

### Measuring "Breakthroughness"

**Tasks with high "breakthroughness" generally require sequential steps and logical reasoning - they require a model to apply several distinct skills or perform multiple discrete steps** in order to come up with the correct answer [Medium, BIG-bench Review](https://medium.com/@roshikanayanadhara/review-big-bench-beyond-the-imitation-game-quantifying-and-extrapolating-the-capabilities-of-43c7c23247aa)

**Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting enables emergent task performance on several BIG-Bench Hard tasks with otherwise flat scaling curves** [ArXiv, 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.09261)

## Researcher Surprise: "That Was Never Discussed in Any Literature"

### Academic Astonishment

**"That language models can do these sort of things was never discussed in any literature that I'm aware of," said Rishi Bommasani, a computer scientist at Stanford University** [Quanta Magazine]

**Researchers detecting the first hints that LLMs could reach beyond the constraints of their training data are striving for a better grasp of what emergence looks like and how it happens** [Quanta Magazine]

**The emergence of these abilities genuinely surprised researchers**, with Bommasani helping compile a list of dozens of emergent behaviors, and that list continues to grow [Quanta Magazine]

## OpenAI Hide-and-Seek: Emergent Tool Use (2019)

### The Box Surfing Discovery

**OpenAI observed agents discovering progressively more complex tool use while playing hide-and-seek, building a series of six distinct strategies and counterstrategies, some of which they did not know their environment supported** [OpenAI Blog, 2019](https://openai.com/index/emergent-tool-use/)

**After almost 390 million games came the fifth phase and box surfing, where seekers learned they could use locked ramps by moving a box close to one, climbing the ramp and jumping onto the box** [KDnuggets, October 2019](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/10/openai-tried-train-ai-agents-play-hide-seek-instead-shocked-learned.html)

**"We were not expecting [box surfing] to happen, but it was exciting when it did," according to the researchers** [KDnuggets]

**The seekers learned that they could move boxes even after climbing on top of them, allowing them to "box surf" - a tactic the OpenAI team never saw coming** [MIT Technology Review, September 2019](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/09/17/75427/open-ai-algorithms-learned-tool-use-and-cooperation-after-hide-and-seek-games/)

### Multi-Agent Autocurriculum

**There were no direct incentives for agents to interact with objects or explore; rather, the emergent strategies were a result of the autocurriculum induced by multi-agent competition** and the simple dynamics of hide-and-seek [ArXiv, September 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07528)

**The self-supervised emergent complexity in simple environments suggests that multi-agent co-adaptation may one day produce extremely complex and intelligent behavior** [Quanta Magazine, November 2019](https://www.quantamagazine.org/artificial-intelligence-discovers-tool-use-in-hide-and-seek-games-20191118/)

## Chain of Thought: Emergent at Scale (2022-2024)

### The Breakthrough Discovery

**Such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting**, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting [ArXiv, January 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)

**Importantly, chain-of-thought prompting is an emergent ability of model scale—it does not positively impact performance for small models, and only yields performance gains when used with models of ∼100B parameters** [Google Research Blog, 2022](https://research.google/blog/language-models-perform-reasoning-via-chain-of-thought/)

**Prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems**, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier [ArXiv paper, 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903)

### Enabling Complex Reasoning

**Generating a chain of thought—a series of intermediate reasoning steps—significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning** [NeurIPS 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3600270.3602070)

## OpenAI o1: Reasoning Revolution (September 2024)

### Test-Time Compute Breakthrough

**OpenAI o1 was released as a preview on September 12, 2024, and spends time "thinking" before it answers**, making it better at complex reasoning tasks, science and programming than GPT-4o [OpenAI o1 Hub](https://openai.com/o1/)

**This is the first example of a model with true general reasoning capabilities, which they've achieved with inference-time compute** [Sequoia Capital, 2024](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/generative-ais-act-o1/)

**When we say "inference-time compute" what we mean is asking the model to stop and think before giving you a response**, which requires more compute at inference time [Sequoia]

### Emergent Backtracking and Problem-Solving

**o1 is showing the ability to backtrack when it gets stuck as an emergent property of scaling inference time** [Synthesis AI, February 2025](https://synthesis.ai/2025/02/25/large-reasoning-models-how-o1-replications-turned-into-real-competition/)

**It is also showing the ability to think about problems the way a human would (e.g. visualize the points on a sphere to solve a geometry problem) and to think about problems in new ways** (e.g. solving problems in programming competitions in a way that humans would not) [Synthesis AI]

### Performance Benchmarks

**On the 2024 AIME exams, o1 averaged 74% with a single sample per problem, 83% with consensus among 64 samples, and 93% when re-ranking 1000 samples** with a learned scoring function, placing it among the top 500 students nationally [OpenAI Blog, September 2024](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)

**OpenAI o1 ranks in the 89th percentile on competitive programming questions (Codeforces)**, places among the top 500 students in the US in a qualifier for the USA Math Olympiad (AIME), and exceeds human PhD-level accuracy on a benchmark of physics, biology, and chemistry problems (GPQA) [OpenAI]

**Recent survey data shows OpenAI's o1 model achieved 83.3% accuracy on Competition Math (AIME 2024), vastly surpassing GPT-4o's 13.4%**, and in Codeforces programming, o1 reached 89.0% accuracy while GPT-4o managed only 11.0% [ArXiv Survey, March 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05788)

## GNoME: Emergent Generalization in Materials Discovery (2023-2024)

### Google DeepMind's Materials Breakthrough

**GNoME discovered 2.2 million new crystals, of which 380,000 are the most stable**, making them promising candidates for experimental synthesis [Google DeepMind Blog, 2023](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/millions-of-new-materials-discovered-with-deep-learning/)

**Thanks to GNoME, the number of known stable materials has grown almost tenfold, to 421,000** [Nature, November 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06735-9)

**External researchers in labs around the world have independently created 736 of these new structures experimentally in concurrent work** [MIT Technology Review, November 2023](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/29/1084061/deepmind-ai-tool-for-new-materials-discovery/)

### The Emergent Generalization Discovery

**Graph networks trained at scale can reach unprecedented levels of generalization, improving the efficiency of materials discovery by an order of magnitude** [Nature paper]

**The study demonstrated emergent generalization to out-of-distribution tasks by testing structural models on high-energy local minima data that was out of distribution compared with training data**, observing clear improvement with scale [GitHub, GNoME](https://github.com/google-deepmind/materials_discovery)

**The test loss performance of GNoME models exhibits improvement as a power law with further data, which is in line with neural scaling laws in deep learning** and suggests that further discovery efforts could continue to improve generalization [Nature]

## Key Insight for Research Theme

**The "emergence debate" represents a fundamental tension in understanding AI**: Are these capabilities truly unpredictable phase transitions that emerge at scale, or are they smooth progressions that only appear sudden due to measurement artifacts? This question has profound implications for AI safety, policy, and our understanding of intelligence itself.

**Community fascination stems from the violation of intuitive expectations**: When GPT-3 suddenly learns to add numbers at 13 billion parameters, or OpenAI agents invent "box surfing" after 390 million games, or DINOv2 develops semantic segmentation without ever seeing labels, it challenges our understanding of what "learning" means. These aren't programmed features - they're spontaneous organizational patterns that emerge from scale and interaction.

**The connection to vision transformer "three clusters"**: DINO's attention heads spontaneously specializing parallels how o1 spontaneously learns to backtrack when stuck, how GNoME spontaneously generalizes to out-of-distribution materials, and how hide-and-seek agents spontaneously invent multi-step tool use. All represent self-organization without explicit programming.

**The policy tension**: If capabilities can emerge unpredictably, how do we ensure AI safety? The Stanford "mirage" paper's Congressional impact shows how scientific debates rapidly become policy debates. Georgetown CSET's careful analysis tries to separate measurement artifacts from genuine emergence - crucial for rational regulation.

**Researcher surprise as a recurring theme**: "That was never discussed in any literature" (Bommasani), "We were not expecting box surfing" (OpenAI team), "continuously surprised by creative capabilities" (Sakana AI) - even the experts building these systems are surprised by what emerges. This genuine astonishment drives community interest and concern.

**2024-2025 shift**: From simple emergent abilities (addition, translation) to complex emergent reasoning (o1's backtracking), emergent research capabilities (AI Scientist), and emergent generalization (GNoME). The phenomenon is accelerating and becoming more sophisticated.
