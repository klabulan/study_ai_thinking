**Key Context**:
- Survey of 2,500+ business and technology leaders
- Only 5% of AI pilots achieve meaningful P&L impact
- 95% have "no measurable impact on profit and loss statements" [Tom's Hardware, 2025](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/95-percent-of-generative-ai-implementations-in-enterprise-have-no-measurable-impact-on-p-and-l-says-mit-flawed-integration-key-reason-why-ai-projects-underperform)

**Impact**: This finding "spooked investors" but should have alarmed C-suite executives more [Fortune Commentary, August 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/08/21/an-mit-report-that-95-of-ai-pilots-fail-spooked-investors-but-the-reason-why-those-pilots-failed-is-what-should-make-the-c-suite-anxious/)

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **Poor data quality** - insufficient or unreliable training data
2. **Inadequate risk controls** - governance and compliance failures
3. **Escalating costs** - budget overruns beyond initial projections

**Specific Examples**:
- Simple document search via RAG: **$750,000+** upfront cost
- Early adopters struggling with escalating costs beyond projections
- GenAI requires "higher tolerance for indirect, future financial investment" vs immediate ROI

### Low Business Value Realization
**Finding**: Gartner survey of 822 business leaders found minimal returns [Gartner, 2024](https://aibusiness.com/automation/gartner-predicts-30-of-generative-ai-initiatives-will-fail-by-2025):
- **15.8%** reported revenue increases
- **15.2%** achieved cost savings
- **22.6%** noticed productivity improvements
- **Majority saw no measurable benefit**

### Future Trajectory: Agentic AI Failures
**Finding**: Over 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by end of 2027 [Gartner, June 2025](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-06-25-gartner-predicts-over-40-percent-of-agentic-ai-projects-will-be-canceled-by-end-of-2027)
