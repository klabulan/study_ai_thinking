## 1. KNIGHT CAPITAL GROUP: $460 MILLION IN 45 MINUTES (2012)

### The Incident
**Date**: August 1, 2012
**Loss**: $460 million in 45 minutes
**Outcome**: Company bankruptcy, acquired by Getco LLC [Multiple sources](https://www.henricodolfing.com/2019/06/project-failure-case-study-knight-capital.html)

### What Went Wrong
**Root Cause**: Software deployment error, not technically AI but algorithmic trading failure [Doug Seven, "Knightmare: A DevOps Cautionary Tale"](https://dougseven.com/2014/04/17/knightmare-a-devops-cautionary-tale/)

**Technical Failure**:
- Technician **forgot to copy new Retail Liquidity Program (RLP) code** to one of eight SMARS computer servers
- RLP code repurposed a flag formerly used to activate old "Power Peg" function
- Orders sent with repurposed flag to eighth server **triggered defective Power Peg code** still present
- Power Peg designed to buy stock at ask price, immediately sell at bid price, losing spread value
- **Server sent orders indefinitely** without stopping

### Scale of Damage
**Trading Impact** [Bloomberg, August 2012](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-08-02/knight-shows-how-to-lose-440-million-in-30-minutes):
- For 212 incoming parent orders processed by defective code
- Knight sent **millions of child orders**
- Resulting in **4 million executions in 154 stocks**
- **397 million shares** traded in approximately 45 minutes
- Knight lost over $460 million from unwanted positions

**Market Consequences**:
- By next day, Knight's stock price **dropped by 75%**
- August 5: raised ~$400 million from investors led by Jefferies to stay in business
- December 2012: agreed to acquisition by Getco LLC
- SEC: Knight Capital Americas agreed to pay **$12 million** to settle charges of violating market access rule [SEC Press Release 2013-222](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2013-222)

### Lessons

## 2. AMAZON AI RECRUITING TOOL: GENDER BIAS (2014-2018)

### The Project
**Timeline**: 2014 development began, 2015 bias discovered, project canceled
**Impact**: System discriminated against women in tech hiring [Carnegie Mellon University ML News](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/news/news-archive/2016-2020/2018/october/amazon-scraps-secret-artificial-intelligence-recruiting-engine-that-showed-biases-against-women.html)

### Background
**Objective**: Amazon engineers began building algorithm to **automate hiring** by reviewing resumes and ranking candidates **1-5 stars**
**Training Data**: System trained on **10 years of resumes** company had received [MIT Technology Review, October 2018](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/10/10/139858/amazon-ditched-ai-recruitment-software-because-it-was-biased-against-women/)

### The Problem
**Gender Discrimination Discovered**:
- Project canned after just one year when clear the tool **systematically discriminated against women** applying for technical jobs
- By 2015, Amazon realized system **not rating candidates for software developer jobs in gender-neutral way**
- System would **penalize resumes containing word "women's"** or names of certain all-women colleges
- Technology favored candidates using verbs like **"executed" and "captured"** commonly found on male engineer resumes

### Root Causes
**Data Bias** [ACLU Analysis](https://www.aclu.org/news/womens-rights/why-amazons-automated-hiring-tool-discriminated-against):
- Tech is male-dominated industry
- Majority of training resumes came from men
- Existing pool of Amazon software engineers overwhelmingly male
- New software fed data about those engineers' resumes
- **Reproducing demographics of existing workforce virtually guaranteed**

### Amazon's Response
**Attempted Fixes Failed**:
- Amazon made changes to make discriminatory terms neutral
- Company **lost confidence** program was gender neutral in all other areas
- Amazon **stopped using software** when clear problem wasn't going away despite programmers' efforts [Case Study Analysis](https://www.cut-the-saas.com/ai/case-study-how-amazons-ai-recruiting-tool-learnt-gender-bias)

### Legacy
**Landmark Example**:
- Widely cited in discussions about **AI ethics and fairness**
- "The world has a nifty new cautionary tale from this failure" [Women of HR Commentary](https://womenofhr.com/a-cautionary-tale-amazons-experiment-with-ai-in-hiring/)
- "Should serve as cautionary tale, uncovering current limitations of technology that, for all its potential, is still in its infancy"

**Immediate "Fix"**:
- Remove tag "gorillas" from all photos - **even those of actual gorillas**
- Meant to be **temporary patch**
- Extended to many primate terms

### The "Solution" That Wasn't
**Censorship Approach** [MIT Technology Review, January 2018](https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/01/11/146257/google-photos-still-has-a-problem-with-gorillas/):
- Instead of fixing problem, Google chose to **eliminate problematic tags themselves**
- Resulted in no auto-tags for terms: "gorilla," "chimp," "chimpanzee," "monkey"
- Google **censored image tags relating to many primates**

### Long-Term Failure
**2023 Status** [PetaPixel, May 2023](https://petapixel.com/2023/05/22/googles-photos-app-is-still-unable-to-find-gorillas/):
- **Eight years later**, even with huge advances in AI technology

- Automated car **lacked capability to classify object as pedestrian** unless near crosswalk
- Car couldn't recognize Herzberg as pedestrian or person
- Instead **alternating between classifications**: "vehicle, bicycle, and other"
- Couldn't correctly predict her path
- Concluded needed to brake just **1.3 seconds before impact** - too late [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/self-driving-uber-car-hit-killed-woman-did-not-recognize-n1079281)

### Human Factors
**Backup Driver Inattention** [IEEE Spectrum NTSB Report](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ntsb-investigation-into-deadly-uber-selfdriving-car-crash-reveals-lax-attitude-toward-safety):
- Rafaela Vasquez **watching television on smartphone** during trip
- National Transportation Safety Board 2019 investigation found Vasquez **looking away from road for over one-third of trip**

### Legal Outcomes

## 7. COMPAS RECIDIVISM ALGORITHM: RACIAL BIAS IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

### Background
**System**: COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)
**Developer**: Northpointe (now Equivant)
**Purpose**: Used by U.S. courts to assess likelihood of defendant becoming recidivist [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMPAS_(software))

**Methodology**:
- Assigns defendants **scores from 1 to 10** indicating reoffense likelihood
- Based on **more than 100 factors**: age, sex, criminal history
- **Notably, race is not used** as explicit factor

### ProPublica Investigation (2016)
**Research Goals** [ProPublica "Machine Bias"](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing):
- Assess Northpointe's tool to discover underlying accuracy
- Test whether algorithm biased against certain groups

**Key Findings** [ProPublica Analysis Methodology](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm):
- Black defendants **far more likely than white defendants** to be incorrectly judged at higher risk of recidivism
- **"Blacks are almost twice as likely as whites"** to be labeled higher risk but not actually re-offend
- COMPAS **"makes opposite mistake among whites"**: much more likely than blacks to be labeled lower-risk but commit other crimes
- Black defendants were **77% more likely** to be pegged as higher risk of committing future violent crime
- **45% more likely** to be predicted to commit future crime of any kind

### The Fairness Debate
**Algorithmic Fairness Question** [Washington Post Analysis](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/10/17/can-an-algorithm-be-racist-our-analysis-is-more-cautious-than-propublicas/):
- "What does it mean for algorithm to be fair?"
- At heart of disagreement between ProPublica and Northpointe is **subtle ethical question**

**Northpointe's Defense**:
- Test was **racially neutral**
- Rate of accuracy for COMPAS scores - about **60%** - same for black and white defendants
- Algorithm satisfies different fairness criterion

### Mathematical Reality
**Impossibility Result** [ProPublica Follow-up, "Bias is Mathematically Inevitable"](https://www.propublica.org/article/bias-in-criminal-risk-scores-is-mathematically-inevitable-researchers-say):
- Researchers found formula, and others like it, written in way that **guarantees black defendants will be inaccurately identified** as future criminals more often than white counterparts
- **"Actually impossible for risk score to satisfy both fairness criteria at same time"**

### Academic Impact
**Ongoing Research**:
- [Kaggle Dataset: COMPAS Recidivism Racial Bias](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danofer/compass) for continued analysis
- ["How to Argue with an Algorithm: Lessons from the COMPAS-ProPublica Debate"](http://ctlj.colorado.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/17.1_4-Washington_3.18.19.pdf) - Colorado Technology Law Journal
- ["Response to 'How we analyzed the COMPAS recidivism algorithm'"](https://jeffreyfossett.com/2020/02/20/compas-response.html) - ongoing scholarly debate
- [Fairness & Algorithmic Decision Making textbook chapter](https://afraenkel.github.io/fairness-book/content/04-compas.html)

### Legacy
- ProPublica investigation had **lasting impact** on discussions of algorithmic fairness
- Data and code made **publicly available** for further research
- Demonstrates inherent tensions in defining "fairness" for predictive algorithms

## 13. NETHERLANDS CHILD BENEFITS SCANDAL (2013-2021)

### Overview
**Scale**: **Tens of thousands of parents and caregivers** from mostly low-income families falsely accused of fraud [Amnesty International Report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/10/xenophobic-machines-dutch-child-benefit-scandal/)
**Impact**: People from **ethnic minorities disproportionately impacted**
**Government Admission**: May 25, 2022 - Dutch government publicly admitted for first time that **institutional racism** was root cause [European Parliament Question O-000028/2022](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/O-9-2022-000028_EN.html)

### Algorithmic Discrimination
**How It Worked** [Amnesty International Full Report](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur35/4686/2021/en/):
- **Racial profiling baked into design** of algorithmic system
- Used to determine whether claims for childcare benefit flagged as incorrect and potentially fraudulent
- Tax authorities used information on whether applicant had **Dutch nationality as risk factor**
- **Non-Dutch nationals received higher risk-scores**
- Dutch Tax and Customs Administration used algorithms where **'foreign sounding names' and 'dual nationality' used as indicators of potential fraud**

**Self-Learning Mechanism**:
- Discriminatory design flaws **reproduced by self-learning mechanism**
- Algorithm adapted over time based on experience
- **No meaningful human oversight** [SAGE Journals: Digital Welfare](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/13882627211031257)

### Devastating Consequences
**Human Impact**:
- Thousands of (racialized) low- and middle-income families subjected to scrutiny
- **Falsely accused of fraud**
- Asked to **pay back benefits** obtained completely legally
- Some **lost homes or jobs**
- **More than 1,000 children** taken out of homes and placed in state custody as result of accusations [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal)

**Political Impact**:
- Scandal **brought down Dutch government** in January 2021

### The SyRI System
**Background** [AlgorithmWatch Investigation](https://algorithmwatch.org/en/syri-netherlands-algorithm/):
- Dutch government using **SyRI** (System Risk Indication), a **secret algorithm**, to detect possible social welfare fraud
- Concrete risk model used in practical applications of SyRI **remains secret**

### Court Ruling (February 2020)
**The Hague Court Decision** [Oxford Academic Human Rights Law Review](https://academic.oup.com/hrlr/article/22/2/ngac010/6568079):
- Court of first instance ruled SyRI legislation **did not strike fair balance** between fraud detection interest and **human right to privacy**
- Dutch government **did not appeal** - ruling became final
- **Use of SyRI was banned**

**Court's Key Finding**:
- **"There is in fact a risk that SyRI inadvertently creates links based on bias, such as lower socio-economic status or immigration background"**
- To date, SyRI has **only been applied in poor neighborhoods** ('problem districts')

### Continued Violations
**Despite Ban** [Lighthouse Reports Investigation](https://www.lighthousereports.com/investigation/the-algorithm-addiction/):
- Legal experts, including original SyRI coalition, confirmed government had **silently continued to deploy slightly adapted SyRI**
- In some of country's **most vulnerable neighborhoods**

## 14. UK EXAM ALGORITHM FIASCO (2020)

### Background
**Context**: COVID-19 pandemic - all secondary education examinations canceled [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_UK_GCSE_and_A-Level_grading_controversy)
**Solution**: UK government and Ofqual replaced school examinations with **automatically computed A-Level grades** in England and Wales

### The Algorithm
**Design** [CNBC Analysis](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/computer-algorithm-caused-a-grading-crisis-in-british-schools.html):
- Ofqual produced **grades standardization algorithm** to combat grade inflation
- Moderate teacher-predicted grades for A-level and GCSE qualifications
- Algorithm factored in **school attainment in each subject over previous three years**
- Education Secretary Gavin Williamson instructed Ofqual to "ensure, as far as possible, **qualification standards maintained** and distribution of grades follows **similar profile to previous years**"

### The Results
**Announcement**: A-Level grades announced August 13, 2020 in England, Wales, Northern Ireland [BERA Blog](https://www.bera.ac.uk/blog/the-great-algorithm-fiasco)
**Impact**:
- Nearly **36% one grade lower** than teachers' predictions
- **3% down two grades**

- Analysis revealed it **disproportionately hurt students from working-class and disadvantaged communities**
- **Inflated scores of students from private schools** [University of Bristol Centre for Multilevel Modelling](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/research/grade/)

### Public Outcry
**Student Protests** [LSE Impact Blog](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2020/08/26/fk-the-algorithm-what-the-world-can-learn-from-the-uks-a-level-grading-fiasco/):
- **Hundreds of students** gathered in front of Department for Education
- Chanted **"f**k the algorithm"**
- Within days, protests prompted officials to **reverse course** and throw out test scores

### The U-Turn
**Policy Reversal** [PMC Analysis](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10370707/):
- Grades awarded by algorithm have been **withdrawn in favor of teacher predictions**
- Marking **one of biggest ever U-turns in UK education history**
- After criticism, Ofqual with HM Government support, **withdrew these grades**
- Issued all students **Centre Assessed Grades (CAGs)** produced by teachers

### Academic Research
**Scholarly Analysis**:
- [British Educational Research Journal, Wiley](https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/berj.3705): "A tale of two algorithms: The appeal and repeal of calculated grades systems in England and Ireland in 2020"
- [Ofqual Analytics](https://analytics.ofqual.gov.uk/apps/Alevel/Outcomes/): A level outcomes data
- [Wikipedia: Ofqual exam results algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofqual_exam_results_algorithm)

### Legacy
