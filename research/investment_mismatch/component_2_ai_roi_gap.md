## The Investment Landscape: Massive Capital, Minimal Returns

### Goldman Sachs: $200 Billion Global Investment by 2025

Goldman Sachs Research estimates AI investment could approach $100 billion in the U.S. and $200 billion globally by 2025. The report projects that global private investment in AI is forecasted to rise dramatically from an estimated $91.9 billion in 2022 to over $158.4 billion in 2025 [AI Investment Forecast to Approach $200 Billion Globally by 2025, Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/ai-investment-forecast-to-approach-200-billion-globally-by-2025)

**Economic Impact Projections:**
Generative AI has enormous economic potential and could boost global labor productivity by more than 1 percentage point a year in the decade following widespread usage. Goldman Sachs economists believe AI investment could account for up to 4% of GDP in the US by 2025 and 2.5% of GDP in other countries that are leading AI development, which is about double the impact of electricity and personal computers [Global Investment in AI Could Near $200 Billion by 2025, Fox Business, 2023](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/global-investment-ai-could-near-200-billion-2025-goldman-sachs)

**US Leadership:**
Private investment in AI within the U.S. accounted for more than half of global investment in 2022, coming in at $47.4 billion of the $91.9 billion global total [AI Investment Could Reach $200B Globally by 2025, CoinDesk, 2023](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/03/ai-investment-could-reach-200b-globally-by-2025-goldman-sachs)

### IDC: AI Spending to Hit $632 Billion by 2028

In 2024, organizations are projected to spend $235 billion on AI, a figure that is expected to nearly triple, reaching over $630 billion by 2028, fueled by an almost 30% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). The rapid incorporation of AI, and generative AI (GenAI) in particular, into a wide range of products will result in a CAGR of 29.0% over the 2024-2028 forecast period [Worldwide Spending on Artificial Intelligence Forecast to Reach $632 Billion in 2028, IDC](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52530724)

**Generative AI Growth:**
Generative AI accounts for 17.2% of global AI spending today, and its growth is particularly remarkable, with projections indicating it will make up 32% of AI investments by 2028, driven by a staggering 60% five-year CAGR [IDC's Worldwide AI and Generative AI Spending – Industry Outlook, IDC Blog, 2024](https://blogs.idc.com/2024/08/21/idcs-worldwide-ai-and-generative-ai-spending-industry-outlook/)

**AI Infrastructure Investment:**
Organizations increased spending on compute and storage hardware infrastructure for AI deployments by 97% year-over-year in the first half of 2024, reaching $47.4 billion. The global Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure market is on track to surpass $200 billion USD in spending by 2028 [Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Spending to Surpass the $200Bn USD Mark in the Next 5 Years, IDC](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52758624)

## The Value Realization Crisis

### BCG: 74% of Companies Fail to Show Tangible AI Value

Seventy-four percent of companies have yet to show tangible value from their use of AI, according to Boston Consulting Group's October 2024 report titled "Where's the Value in AI?" Only 26% of companies have developed the necessary set of capabilities to move beyond proofs of concept and generate tangible value [AI Adoption in 2024: 74% of Companies Struggle to Achieve and Scale Value, BCG, 2024](https://www.bcg.com/press/24october2024-ai-adoption-in-2024-74-of-companies-struggle-to-achieve-and-scale-value)

**Detailed Breakdown:**
Only 22% of companies have advanced beyond the proof-of-concept stage to generate some value, and only 4% are creating substantial value. The report is based on a comprehensive survey of 1,000 CxOs and senior executives from over 20 sectors, spanning 59 countries in Asia, Europe, and North America [Where's the Value in AI?, BCG, October 2024](https://media-publications.bcg.com/BCG-Wheres-the-Value-in-AI.pdf)

**AI Leaders vs Laggards:**
Over the past three years, AI leaders have achieved 1.5 times higher revenue growth, 1.6 times greater shareholder returns, and 1.4 times higher returns on invested capital. AI's greatest value lies in core business processes where leaders are generating 62% of the value [BCG Report: Only 26% of Companies Seeing Real Value from AI, Supply Chain 24/7, 2024](https://www.supplychain247.com/article/companies-struggle-create-value-artificial-intelligence-bcg-survery)

### NTT DATA: 70-85% of GenAI Deployments Failing ROI

NTT DATA reports that "somewhere between 70-85% of current AI initiatives fail to meet their expected outcomes." In 2019, MIT cited that 70% of AI efforts saw little to no impact after deployment. Since then, the figure has been expected to increase, with some predicting as high as 85% of AI projects missing expectations—a figure much greater than the 25-50% regular IT project failure rate [Between 70-85% of GenAI Deployment Efforts Are Failing to Meet Their Desired ROI, NTT DATA, 2024](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/insights/focus/2024/between-70-85p-of-genai-deployment-efforts-are-failing)

Additional reasons for AI project failure include poor data hygiene and governance, lack of proper AI operations, inappropriate internal infrastructure, and failure to choose the right product or proof of concept.

### McKinsey: Limited Enterprise-Wide Impact Despite High Adoption

71% of organizations regularly use generative AI in at least one business function as of 2024, up from 65% in early 2024. This represents a dramatic increase from 2023, when only 34% reported using this technology [The State of AI: How Organizations Are Rewiring to Capture Value, McKinsey, 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)

**Maturity Challenge:**
Despite widespread adoption, most respondents have yet to see organization-wide, bottom-line impact from gen AI use, and only 1% of company executives describe their gen AI rollouts as "mature" [The State of AI March 2025, McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/quantumblack/our%20insights/the%20state%20of%20ai/2025/the-state-of-ai-how-organizations-are-rewiring-to-capture-value_final.pdf)

**Revenue Impact by Function:**
McKinsey's 2024 surveys showed varying revenue increases across business functions:
- Strategy and corporate finance: 70% reported revenue increase (11% at >10%, 12% at 6-10%, and 47% at ≤5%)
- Marketing and sales: 66% (8% at >10%, 24% at 6-10%, and 34% at ≤5%)
- Supply chain and inventory management: 53% (5% at >10%, 18% at 6-10%, and 30% at ≤5%)

A handful of leading companies already attributed more than 10% of their EBIT (operating profits) to generative AI deployments in early 2024, showing significant returns for AI leaders while many organizations still struggle to demonstrate value [The State of AI 2024: Main Takeaways from McKinsey Report, Switch Software, 2024](https://www.switchsoftware.io/post/ai-in-2024-gen-ai-rise-and-business-impact)

### Bain: Fewer Than 20% Scale GenAI Efforts

Fewer than 20% of companies have scaled their generative AI efforts in any meaningful way, with most companies remaining stuck in experimentation mode. More than 60% of companies surveyed see generative AI as a top three priority over the next two years, but only about 35% have a clearly defined vision for how they will create business value from generative AI [Are You Organized to Reap Value from Generative AI?, Bain & Company, 2024](https://www.bain.com/insights/are-you-organized-to-reap-value-from-generative-ai/)

**Scaling Challenges:**
- Slightly more than half of commercial organizations acknowledge that they have not set up adequate technology and data foundations to optimize AI
- 75% of companies struggle to find the in-house expertise they need across critical functions
- Roughly a quarter of respondents' sales and marketing AI pilots have failed, and among the AI use cases in pilot phase, roughly one-fifth are not meeting expectations

[Unsticking Your AI Transformation, Bain & Company, 2024](https://www.bain.com/insights/unsticking-your-ai-transformation/)

**Unrealized Efficiency Gains:**
Generative AI appears to save about 10% to 15% of total software engineering time, according to Bain's survey of more than 200 companies, however, most companies aren't making the most of these savings [Survey: Generative AI's Uptake Is Unprecedented Despite Roadblocks, Bain & Company, 2024](https://www.bain.com/insights/survey-generative-ai-uptake-is-unprecedented-despite-roadblocks/)

## The Pilot-to-Production Crisis

### Multiple Sources Confirm Low Success Rates

**MIT Report:**
About 5% of AI pilot programs achieve rapid revenue acceleration, while the vast majority stall. This translates to 95% of companies experiencing generative AI implementation falling short [MIT Report: 95% of Generative AI Pilots at Companies Are Failing, Fortune, 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/)

**S&P Global Market Intelligence:**
42% of companies abandoned most of their AI initiatives in 2025 — up from just 17% in 2024, based on S&P Global Market Intelligence's survey of over 1,000 enterprises. The average organization scrapped 46% of AI proof-of-concepts before they reached production [AI Project Failure Rates Are on the Rise: Report, CIO Dive, 2025](https://www.ciodive.com/news/AI-project-fail-data-SPGlobal/742590/)

**IDC Research:**
For every 33 AI POCs a company launched, only four graduated to production. Only 15% of businesses have successfully scaled their AI projects beyond the initial pilot, according to Forrester [Why Most Enterprise AI Projects Fail — And the Patterns That Actually Work, WorkOS](https://workos.com/blog/why-most-enterprise-ai-projects-fail-patterns-that-work)

### AI Fatigue: The Human Cost of Repeated Failures

The share of companies that scrapped the majority of their AI initiatives jumped from 17% in 2024 to 42% in 2025. Against the backdrop of more than two years of rapid AI development and the pressure that has come with it, some company leaders facing repeated AI failures are starting to feel fatigued ['AI Fatigue' Is Settling In as Companies' Proofs of Concept Increasingly Fail, Fortune, 2025](https://fortune.com/2025/06/11/ai-companies-employee-fatigue-failure/)

**Employee Burnout:**
Employees who consider themselves frequent AI users reported higher levels of burnout (45%) compared to those who infrequently (38%) or never (35%) use AI at work, according to Quantum Workplace research [AI Fatigue: Why So Many AI POCs Fail & How to Prevent It, Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/fixing-ai-fatigue-poc-failures)

**Why POCs Fail:**
- Businesses exploring the wrong use cases or misunderstanding the various subsets of AI
- Many companies are abandoning AI projects after the POC stage due to unclear goals, poor planning, and a lack of internal readiness
- Gartner predicted that at least 30% of generative AI (GenAI) projects will be discontinued after proof of concept by the end of 2025

## CFO Perspective: The ROI Ultimatum

### Half of CFOs Will Cut AI Investment Without Quick ROI

Half of CFOs (50%) report they will axe AI investment if it fails to deliver measurable ROI within a year, according to a Basware survey of 400 global CFOs conducted in 2024. About half (48%) of finance leaders polled said that if an AI investment does not deliver measurable ROI within a year, it would be difficult to justify further investment [Half of CFOs Will Axe AI Investment If It Doesn't Show ROI Next Year, The CFO, 2024](https://the-cfo.io/2024/11/13/half-of-cfos-will-axe-ai-investment-if-it-doesnt-show-roi-next-year/)

**ROI Timeline Expectations:**
More than three-quarters (78%) of the C-suite and senior business leaders surveyed, all from companies with $1 billion or more in revenue, are confident they will see returns on their investments in gen AI within one to three years, according to KPMG's 2024 survey [78% of Business Leaders Expect ROI on Generative AI Investments in 1 to 3 Years, CFO.com, 2024](https://www.cfo.com/news/78-of-leaders-at-billion-dollar-companies-expect-roi-on-generative-ai-KPMG-genai-survey-2024/725156/)

While 31% of leaders anticipate measuring ROI in six months, most recognize that productivity and operational efficiency, rather than immediate profitability, are the key returns from AI in its early stages.

### Current ROI Performance Falls Short

Median reported ROI is just 10%—well below the 20% many are targeting—and nearly a third of finance leaders say they've seen only limited gains, according to a BCG March 2025 survey [How to Get ROI from AI in the Finance Function, BCG, 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/how-finance-leaders-can-get-roi-from-ai)

However, organizations prioritising AI investment are realising a return of 136% ROI, with savings exceeding $1.36 for every $1m invested over the duration of three years in accounts payable automation specifically [The ROI Puzzle of AI Investments in 2025, The CFO, 2025](https://the-cfo.io/2025/01/17/the-roi-puzzle-of-ai-investments-in-2025/)

### Investment Pressure and Budget Trends

Nearly two-thirds (65%) of the finance leaders surveyed in IBM's 2024 CFO Study said they are feeling pressure to accelerate ROI across the organization's technology portfolio [65% of CFOs Are Under Pressure to Accelerate ROI from Tech Investments, CFO.com, 2024](https://www.cfo.com/news/65-of-cfos-are-under-pressure-to-get-roi-from-technology-IBM-CFO-2024-report/726806/)

Despite pressure for quick returns, 78% said they desire to increase their investment in AI over the next 12 to 18 months, and 79% of CFOs surveyed indicate that their AI budget will increase in 2025, according to Bain Capital Ventures' survey of 50 CFOs [CFOs Hope to Ramp Up AI Investment, CFO.com](https://www.cfo.com/news/cfos-hope-to-ramp-up-ai-investment/733229/)

## Business Case and Financial Justification Challenges

### Complexity of AI Business Cases

Business cases for AI projects are notably complex to develop because costs and benefits are harder to predict than most other IT projects, with challenges including additional layers of complexity, opaqueness and unpredictability not found in standard technology [How to Build the Business Case for AI Initiatives, TechTarget](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/tip/How-to-build-the-business-case-for-AI-initiatives)

There's broad consensus that AI will play a major role in business, but making a strong business case based on solid ROI calculations remains a challenge. Despite AI's growing momentum, 30% of Chief Data and Analytics Officers struggle to measure the impact of data, analytics, and AI on business outcomes [How To Build A Business Case For Artificial Intelligence, Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-build-a-business-case-for-artificial-intelligence)

### Specific Financial Justification Issues

**Immediate Cost vs Delayed Benefits:**
AI projects can appear costly without any immediate gains — particularly for loosely bound scenarios and in organizations that aren't used to setting aside budget for solutions for new business scenarios [Building A Business Case For AI In Financial Services, 66degrees](https://66degrees.com/building-a-business-case-for-ai-in-financial-services/)

**Proof-of-Concept Purgatory:**
"Proof-of-concept purgatory" occurs when AI experiments never graduate to full deployments because they fail to deliver a compelling business case. Some AI projects are pursued because of the technology's novelty rather than alignment with business strategy, and in other cases, benefits such as improved decision quality or process optimization may not be immediately measurable in financial terms, making further investment harder to justify [The 7 Biggest AI Adoption Challenges for 2025, Stack AI](https://www.stack-ai.com/blog/the-biggest-ai-adoption-challenges)

### MIT Sloan: Strategy-Execution Gap

MIT Sloan Management Review's research reveals that "the gap between ambition and execution is large at most companies." This finding comes from MIT Sloan's partnership with The Boston Consulting Group on AI and business strategy research, based on a global survey of more than 3,000 executives, managers, and analysts across industries [Making the Most of AI: The Latest Lessons from MIT Sloan Management Review, MIT Sloan, 2024](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/making-most-ai-latest-lessons-mit-sloan-management-review)

**Readiness Gap:**
Stewart Bond, Research Vice President for Data Integration and Intelligence at IDC, noted, "Generative AI has sparked widespread excitement, but our findings reveal a significant readiness gap." Without addressing key issues such as data accuracy and governance, businesses risk falling into an "AI scramble," where ambition outpaces their ability to implement effective solutions [Businesses Face Significant AI Adoption Gap, Survey Finds, MIT Sloan Management Review Middle East](https://www.mitsloanme.com/article/businesses-face-significant-ai-adoption-gap-survey-finds/)

## Enterprise Budget Allocation and Spending Patterns

### 2024 AI Spending Surge

Enterprise buyers poured $4.6 billion into generative AI applications in 2024, an almost 8x increase from $600 million in 2023. The average monthly spend on AI was $62,964 in 2024, projected to rise to $85,521 in 2025 (a 36% increase) [2024: The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise, Menlo Ventures](https://menlovc.com/2024-the-state-of-generative-ai-in-the-enterprise/)

### Budget Source and Allocation

60% of enterprise generative AI investments came from innovation budgets, while 40% of spending was sourced from more permanent budgets—58% of which was redirected from existing allocations [How 100 Enterprise CIOs Are Building and Buying Gen AI in 2025, Andreessen Horowitz](https://a16z.com/ai-enterprise-2025/)

**Spending by Category:**
Public cloud platforms received the largest share of AI budgets (11%), while generative AI tools followed at 10% [The New Economics of Enterprise Technology in an AI World, McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-new-economics-of-enterprise-technology-in-an-ai-world)

**Departmental Allocation:**

## Deloitte and PwC: Governance and Implementation Challenges

### Deloitte: The Pressure to Deliver Quick Value

Deloitte surveyed 2,773 leaders from AI-savvy organizations between July and September 2024 as part of their comprehensive research on Generative AI adoption [State of Generative AI in the Enterprise 2024, Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/what-we-do/capabilities/applied-artificial-intelligence/content/state-of-generative-ai-in-enterprise.html)

**Key Findings Throughout 2024:**
- Q4: No matter how quickly GenAI advances, organizational change only happens so fast
- Q3: Organizations are navigating challenges and measuring value, focusing on data and governance, risk and compliance
- Q2: Moving from pilots and proofs of concept to large-scale deployment
- Q1: Expectations of Generative AI remain high, but many leaders are feeling pressure to quickly realize value while managing risks

[New Deloitte Survey Finds Expectations for Gen AI Remain High, Deloitte, 2024](https://www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/gen-ai-survey.html)

### PwC: The Responsible AI Implementation Gap

PwC's 2024 US Responsible AI Survey found that only 11% of executives have fully implemented fundamental responsible AI capabilities. Risk management and Responsible AI practices have been top of mind for executives, yet there has been limited meaningful action [PwC's 2024 US Responsible AI Survey](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/responsible-ai-survey.html)

**Value Quantification Challenge:**
The top challenge facing Responsible AI is the same as in most risk programs: It's hard to quantify the value of having dodged a bullet, such as avoiding a major scandal from a poor AI interaction [Tech Leaders Face Many Challenges in Getting Value from AI, PwC, 2024](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/executive-leadership-hub/library/election-insights-2024-technology-leaders.html)

**Integration Status:**
Nearly half (49%) of technology leaders in PwC's October 2024 Pulse Survey said that AI was "fully integrated" into their companies' core business strategy, though only a third said AI was fully integrated into products and services [2025 AI Business Predictions, PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html)
