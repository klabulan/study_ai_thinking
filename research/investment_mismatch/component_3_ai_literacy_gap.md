## The AI Skills Shortage Crisis

### Skills Shortage as Top Challenge

Skills shortages are the #1 challenge facing IT leaders looking to implement artificial intelligence in 2024. 68% of IT leaders believe "insufficient skills and expertise" are a challenge when it comes to rolling out AI, with more than a quarter (28%) saying this skills shortage will pose a "major" challenge [Skills Shortage Tops List of AI Challenges for IT Leaders in 2024, Digitalisation World](https://digitalisationworld.com/news/68467/skills-shortage-tops-list-of-ai-challenges-for-it-leaders-in-2024)

### Rapid Acceleration of the Gap

More than half of IT leaders say their companies suffered from an undersupply of AI talent, up from 28% in the previous edition of the report, published in 2023. Even more striking, AI know-how went from being the sixth most scarce technology skill to the No. 1 in 16 months, marking the fastest increase in more than 15 years [AI Skills Shortage Surpasses Big Data, Cybersecurity, CIO Dive](https://www.ciodive.com/news/AI-skill-shortage-adoption-enterprise/750106/)

## The Investment Imbalance: Infrastructure vs. Human Capital

### Infrastructure Spending Surge

Organizations increased spending on compute and storage hardware infrastructure for AI deployments by 97% year-over-year in the first half of 2024, reaching $47.4 billion. The global AI infrastructure market is on track to surpass $200 billion in spending by 2028 [Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Spending to Surpass the $200Bn USD Mark in the Next 5 Years, IDC](https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS52758624)

AI and generative AI, along with enabling technologies like cloud services and security, saw the largest spending increases in 2025, while established areas such as systems and services management, devices, and server infrastructure saw the biggest decreases [IT Spending Pulse: AI Agents and GenAI Reshape Priorities, BCG, 2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/ai-shifts-it-budgets-to-growth-investments)

### Employee Training Investment Gap

There appears to be a significant imbalance between infrastructure and training investments. Four in five U.S. employees want more training on artificial intelligence tools, but only 38% of U.S. executives are currently helping employees become more AI-literate, and more CEOs report investing in the technology (57%) than developing their workforce's skills and capabilities (43%) [A Majority of Workers Want AI Training from Their Companies, World Economic Forum, 2024](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/01/ai-training-workforce/)

Nearly half of employees want more formal training and believe it is the best way to boost AI adoption. Additionally, talent skill gaps account for 46 percent of the reasons behind the perceived slow pace of gen AI tool development [AI in the Workplace: A Report for 2025, McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work)

### Budget Allocation Insights

60% of enterprise generative AI investments came from innovation budgets, while 40% of spending was sourced from more permanent budgets—58% of which was redirected from existing allocations. AI learning and training is getting more budget as enterprises look to upskill, with AI budgets in 2025 either poaching from existing areas or being lumped into broader spending efforts [IT and Technology Spending & Budgets for 2025: Trends & Forecasts, Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/it-tech-spending.html)

### UK Context

UK firms reported the highest average spend on skills — including salaries and training — at an average of ~£100k per company, suggesting some organizations are prioritizing human capital investment alongside infrastructure [Artificial Intelligence Sector Study 2024, GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-sector-study-2024/artificial-intelligence-sector-study-2024)

## Data Literacy as Foundation for AI Readiness

### Interconnected Nature of Data and AI Literacy

Data and AI literacy are deeply intertwined. Without a strong foundation in data—governance, interpretation, and analytical thinking—AI adoption risks becoming a surface-level trend. Organizations investing in both areas are better positioned to extract real value, avoid bias, and accelerate innovation [The DataCamp Data & AI Literacy Report 2025](https://www.datacamp.com/report/data-ai-literacy-report-2025)

### Foundation for AI Readiness

Data literacy— the ability to read, understand, analyze, and interpret data— is the bedrock for enterprise AI readiness. By fostering data literacy among employees, organizations can establish a strong foundation for AI readiness, enabling them to make informed decisions, leverage data-driven insights, and fully capitalize on the transformative potential of AI technologies [Why Data Literacy is the Foundation of AI Readiness, Correlation One](https://www.correlation-one.com/blog/data-literacy-ai-readiness)

### Business Impact

Organizations that invest in data and AI literacy today are better equipped to innovate, compete, and grow responsibly. According to the Gartner Annual CDO Survey, DL is ranked as the second-biggest internal roadblock to the success of organisations, highlighting that lack of data literacy is a major barrier to organizational success [Data Literacy Trends in 2024, DATAVERSITY](https://www.dataversity.net/data-literacy-trends-in-2024/)

### Adoption Patterns

Only 9% of leaders report that no one in their organization uses AI—meaning, for the vast majority, AI is already integrated into workflows. AI is being used regularly: 82% of teams use AI at least once a week, and 39% use it daily [Introducing the State of Data & AI Literacy Report 2025, DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/introducing-the-state-of-data-and-ai-literacy-report-2025)

## The Cost of Poor AI Literacy

### AI Implementation Failures

79% of companies globally expect to incur an "AI debt" as a result of poorly implemented autonomous tools, according to a 2025 Asana report. Some predict as high as 85% of AI projects missing expectations—a figure much greater than the 25-50% regular IT project failure rate [A New Buzzword Is Hanging Over Businesses as They Rush Into AI, CNBC, 2025](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/a-new-buzzword-is-hanging-over-businesses-as-they-rush-into-ai.html)

### Productivity Tax

AI-generated 'workslop' created almost two hours of extra work for people who encountered it, a $186 invisible tax per month, and a $9 million hit to productivity in a year, according to research from BetterUp Labs and Stanford Social Media Lab [2025 AI Business Predictions, PwC](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/ai-analytics/ai-predictions.html)

### Lack of Understanding

Companies are unprepared and lack the infrastructure and oversight required to foster a smooth collaboration between human employees and autonomous AI agents.
