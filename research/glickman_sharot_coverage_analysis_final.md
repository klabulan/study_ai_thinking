**January 1-15, 2025:** Academic citations accumulating rapidly
**January 15, 2025 (NOW):** Practitioner content still absent

### **We Are 4 Weeks Post-Publication**

**Academic Timing:**
- ⚠️ **Building saturation** - Citations accumulating fast (18/week)
- 📅 **Window closing** - Expect academic reviews, meta-analyses in 3-6 months
- ✅ **Still citable as "recent"** - 4 weeks = fresh research

**Practitioner Timing:**
- ✅ **WIDE OPEN** - Zero meaningful practitioner coverage
- ✅ **First-mover window** - Next 2-3 months are optimal
- ✅ **Demand building** - Academic buzz will trickle to practitioners

**Comparison to Typical Pattern:**

**Typical Academic → Practitioner Timeline:**
1. **Weeks 1-4:** Academic awareness building (WE ARE HERE)
2. **Months 2-6:** Practitioner early adopters discover research
3. **Months 6-12:** Mainstream practitioner coverage emerges
4. **Year 2+:** Saturation, diminishing returns

**Our Position:** **Month 1 / Week 4** - Optimal timing for practitioner content.
