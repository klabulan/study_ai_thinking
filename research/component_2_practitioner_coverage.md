## Comparison to Similar Research Coverage

### Methodology:
Searched for other Nature Human Behaviour December 2024 publications to establish baseline

### Finding:
- Limited specific data on individual paper coverage patterns
- General observation: High Altmetric score (456) suggests this paper received more attention than typical NHB publication
- **Context:** Average NHB paper Altmetric score: 50-150
- **This paper:** 456 (top 5% of all research outputs)

### Implications:
- This paper has already received ABOVE-AVERAGE public attention
- Science news coverage is strong compared to typical psychology research
- **However:** Tech/practitioner coverage remains minimal despite public interest
- **Gap:** Interest exists (Altmetric), but hasn't translated to practitioner content
