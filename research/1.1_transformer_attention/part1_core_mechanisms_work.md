## 1. Foundational Transformer Architecture

### Original "Attention Is All You Need" (2017) Architecture

**Core Innovation:**
- Proposes a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms
- Dispenses with recurrence and convolutions entirely
- First sequence transduction model based entirely on attention
- Replaces recurrent layers with multi-headed self-attention

**Encoder-Decoder Structure:**
- **Encoder**: Maps input sequence (x1, ..., xn) to continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn)
- **Decoder**: Generates output sequence (y1, ..., ym) one element at a time
- **N = 6 identical layers** in original architecture

**Layer Components:**

*Encoder Layer (2 sublayers):*
1. Multi-head self-attention mechanism
2. Position-wise fully connected feed-forward network
3. Residual connections around each sublayer
4. Layer normalization after each sublayer

*Decoder Layer (3 sublayers):*
1. Causally masked self-attention
2. Cross-attention over encoder output
3. Position-wise feed-forward network
4. Residual connections and layer normalization

## 2. Modern Decoder-Only Architecture (GPT Family)

### Evolution to Decoder-Only Models

**GPT Architecture (2018-present):**
- Decoder-only transformer architecture
- Focuses on autoregressive text generation
- Predicts next token in sequence
- Architecture largely unchanged from original GPT to modern LLMs

**Decoder-Only Layer Structure (2 sublayers):**
1. **Causally masked self-attention** - prevents looking at future tokens
2. **Feed-forward network** - position-wise transformation
3. **Layer normalization** - applied with residual connections

### Key Architectural Details

**Token Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Tokenization** - convert text to discrete tokens/sub-words
2. **Embedding Layer** - matrix with d columns, V rows (vocabulary size)
3. **Positional Encoding** - adds position information to embeddings
4. **Layer-by-Layer Processing** - N decoder blocks
5. **Final Normalization** - output normalization layer
6. **Linear Classification** - probability distribution for next token

**Layer Normalization Variations:**
- **GPT-1**: Post-normalization
- **GPT-2**: Pre-normalization (layer norm before sublayers)
- **Modern variants**: RMSNorm (Llama), CapsuleNorm, ScaleNorm, FixNorm

## 3. Information Flow Through Transformer Layers

### Token Representation Evolution

**Embedding Process:**
- Token embeddings represent semantic meaning in vector space
- Positional embeddings encode sequence position
- Final input = token embeddings + positional embeddings (element-wise addition)
- Provides both "What" (semantics) and "Where" (position) information

**Layer-by-Layer Processing:**
- Token representations evolve through layers (first block to last)
- Each layer builds more intricate understanding of each token
- Purpose: Create contextualized representations where each token "mixes" information from other tokens
- Uses self-attention mechanism for information integration

**Residual Connections and Stability:**
- Residual connections: y = F(x) + x
- Preserves information flow through network depth
- Mitigates vanishing gradient problem
- Enables training of deeper models
- "Add & norm" pattern around attention and feed-forward sublayers

### Information Preservation

**Position Information Flow:**
- Positional encodings added only in first layer
- Information preserved through residual connections ("bypass routes")
- Enables retention of token position information throughout network depth

**Residual Connection Benefits:**
- Stabilizes training by preserving information flow
- Prevents vanishing gradients in deep networks
- Allows direct information passage from input to output
- Essential for numerical stability and convergence

## 4. Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

### Three Types of Attention in Original Transformer

1. **Self-Attention (Encoder):**
   - Keys, values, and queries from same source
   - All positions can attend to all other positions

2. **Cross-Attention (Encoder-Decoder):**
   - Queries from previous decoder layer
   - Keys and values from encoder output
   - Allows decoder to attend to entire input sequence

3. **Masked Self-Attention (Decoder):**
   - Modified to prevent attending to future positions
   - Maintains causal structure for autoregressive generation

### Modern Decoder-Only Attention

**Causally Masked Self-Attention:**
- Only attention mechanism in decoder-only models
- Prevents tokens from attending to subsequent positions
- Maintains autoregressive property for text generation
- Forms foundation of all modern LLMs (GPT, Claude, Llama)

### Parallelization Advantages

**Key Innovation:**
- Multi-head attention enables parallel processing
- No recurrence eliminates sequential dependencies
- Significantly faster training and inference
- Enables scaling to massive model sizes

## 5. Feed-Forward Networks

### Structure and Function

**Architecture:**
- Two linear layers with optional bias
- Separated by non-linear activation function
- Hidden dimension typically 4X larger than input dimension
- Applied position-wise (same transformation to each position)

**Modern Activation Functions:**
- **GPT-1, BERT**: GELU activation
- **Llama series, PaLM**: SwiGLU activation
- **Research finding**: SwiGLU yields best performance for fixed compute

**Role in Processing:**
- Contains most parameters in transformer model
- Acts as key-value memory storage
- Essential for feature extraction and storage
- Allows retrieval of pre-learned knowledge

## 7. Key Analogies for General Audience

### Factory/Manufacturing Analogies

**Layer Processing as Assembly Line:**
- Each transformer layer = workstation on assembly line
- Tokens = products moving through stations
- Each station (layer) adds more refinement/understanding
- Residual connections = quality control checkpoints

**Information Refinement:**
- Raw text enters as "raw material" (tokens)
- Each layer refines and enriches understanding
- Final output = "finished product" with rich contextual understanding

### Communication Framework

**Two-Phase Processing:**
1. **Communication Phase** (Attention): Tokens "talk" to each other
2. **Computation Phase** (Feed-Forward): Individual token processing

**Meeting Room Analogy:**
- Tokens = people in meeting room
- Attention = structured discussion where everyone can contribute
- Feed-forward = individual reflection/processing time
- Residual connections = meeting minutes preserving key points

## Key Takeaways for Presentation

### For Slide 8: "What happens to tokens next"

**Token Flow Explanation:**
- Tokens don't just pass through once - they're iteratively refined
- Each layer adds more contextual understanding
- Like reading a paragraph multiple times, each pass reveals more meaning
- Residual connections ensure no information is lost

**Progressive Understanding:**
- Layer 1: Basic token recognition
- Middle layers: Relationship building between tokens
- Final layers: Complex contextual understanding
- Each layer builds on previous layers' work

### For Slide 11: "Thinking vs Generation"

**Architectural Support for Distinction:**
- Same mechanism (transformer layers) serves both functions
- Early/middle layers: "Thinking" (building understanding)
- Later layers + final processing: "Generation" (selecting next token)
- Attention mechanism: How AI "focuses" on relevant information
- Feed-forward networks: Where knowledge is stored and retrieved

**Human Parallel:**
- Like how humans read a question (encoding)
- Think about the answer (attention processing)
- Then speak/write response (generation)
- But AI does this for every single token/word

This foundational understanding provides the basis for explaining how transformer architecture enables AI "thinking" through systematic, layer-by-layer information processing and refinement.
