## 1. Transformer-Based Multimodal Fusion Architectures (2024)

### Architecture Categories

**Uni-Transformer vs Multi-Transformer**: Transformer-based large pre-trained models are divided into two main categories: uni-Transformer architecture (where input data from different modalities is jointly processed by a single encoder or stacked encoders, such as VideoBERT, HERO, and NExT-GPT) and multi-Transformers architecture (where input data from different modalities is encoded separately by modality-specific Transformers before being jointly modelled, such as X-llm, UniVL, and ActBERT) [ACM Deep Multimodal Data Fusion, 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3649447).

### Key Fusion Mechanisms

**Cross-Attention Integration**: After feature extraction by their respective ViT encoders, the trajectories are fused using a cross-attention mechanism. The transformer architecture and cross-attention mechanism integrate multimodal CT images and clinical information to enhance diagnostic prediction performance effectively [ACM MLMI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3696271.3696286).

**Bottleneck Transformers**: Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer (MBT) restricts cross-modal attention flow between latent units through tight fusion bottlenecks that force the model to collect and condense the most relevant inputs in each modality, and to later layers of the model, allowing early layers to specialize to information from individual modalities [Google Research MBT, 2022](https://research.google/blog/multimodal-bottleneck-transformer-mbt-a-new-model-for-modality-fusion/).

**Hybrid CNN-Transformer Approaches**: CDDFuse employs Transformers and CNNs in parallel for feature extraction, merging the two to create features that contain both rich local and global information [Frontiers MGFusion, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neurorobotics/articles/10.3389/fnbot.2024.1521603/full).

### Fusion Strategy Combinations

**Multi-Level Attention**: Researchers employ a combination of Transformer modules with Cross-modal Attention and Transformer modules with Self-Attention to further fuse the vectors. In multimodal fusion, attention mechanisms enable models to dynamically weigh the importance of features across different modalities [Medium Multimodal Models Guide, 2024](https://medium.com/@raj.pulapakura/multimodal-models-and-fusion-a-complete-guide-225ca91f6861).

### Recent Breakthroughs

**BEIT-3**: BEIT-3 advanced multimodal learning with Multiway Transformers, enabling simultaneous processing of images, text, and image-text pairs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various visual and vision-language tasks [ACM Deep Multimodal Data Fusion, 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3649447).

---

## 2. Fusion Strategy Taxonomy: Early, Late, and Hybrid (2024)

### Classification Framework

**Four-Category System**: Multimodal fusion methods are traditionally classified into four categories: early fusion, intermediate fusion, late fusion, and hybrid fusion [arXiv Multimodal Alignment and Fusion Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.17040v1).

### Early Fusion

**Input-Level Integration**: Early fusion combines different modalities into a single representation at the input level before processing through a model. The advantage is that dedicated processing for each modality isn't required - data is fused at the input level and processed through the model. However, raw input data may not contain rich semantic information, limiting the model's ability to capture complex interactions between modalities [Medium Multimodal Models Guide, 2024](https://medium.com/@raj.pulapakura/multimodal-models-and-fusion-a-complete-guide-225ca91f6861).

### Late Fusion

**Decision-Level Integration**: Late fusion runs each modality through its own model independently and fuses the outputs (scores) of each modality. It integrates decisions or outputs from modality-specific models after independent processing, often using ensemble or voting techniques. This approach can handle missing data since not all modalities need to be present, but may lose some cross-modal interactions [Medium Multimodal Models Guide, 2024](https://medium.com/@raj.pulapakura/multimodal-models-and-fusion-a-complete-guide-225ca91f6861).

### Hybrid Fusion

**Combined Approach**: Hybrid fusion combines early, intermediate, or late fusion. The hybrid fusion approach considers the benefits of early and late fusion, allowing learning of low-level dependencies between features of different modalities [MDPI Multimodality Fusion Aspects, 2024](https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5354/11/12/1233).

### Intermediate Fusion

**Most Widely Used**: Intermediate fusion is the most widely used strategy, involving processing each modality separately into a latent representation, fusing them, and then doing final processing to produce output scores [arXiv Multimodal Alignment and Fusion Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2411.17040v1).

### Current State of the Field

**No Clear Winner**: Early fusion integrates data at the feature level, late fusion at the decision level, and hybrid fusion combines aspects of both. Recently, transformer-based approaches were introduced in multimodal fusion and outperformed traditional fusion approaches. Research from 2024 shows that it is unclear which fusion technique is best, and it's recommended to develop all fusion approaches before making conclusions on specific datasets [ScienceDirect Comprehensive Survey, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/org/science/article/pii/S1546221824005216).

## 3. Multimodal AI Interpretability and Explainability Research (2024)

### Comprehensive Framework Development

**Three-Perspective Analysis**: A comprehensive survey on the interpretability and explainability of MLLMs proposes a novel framework that categorizes existing research across three perspectives: (I) Data, (II) Model, (III) Training & Inference. This research systematically analyzes interpretability from token-level to embedding-level representations, assesses approaches related to both architecture analysis and design, and explores training and inference strategies that enhance transparency [arXiv MLLM Interpretability Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02104v1).

**Historical Evolution**: Another review categorizes MXAI methods from a historical perspective across four eras: traditional machine learning, deep learning, discriminative foundation models, and generative LLMs. The Era of Generative Large Language Models (2022-2024) sees MXAI methods evolve to address the distinct challenges and opportunities presented by generative LLMs like ChatGPT, with LLMs often restricting direct access, necessitating innovative interpretability methods [arXiv MXAI Review, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.14056v1).

### Breakthrough Systems

**MAIA (Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent)**: MIT researchers developed "MAIA," a system that automates a variety of neural network interpretability tasks using a vision-language model backbone equipped with tools for experimenting on other AI systems. MAIA can generate hypotheses, design experiments to test them, and refine its understanding through iterative analysis. The automated agent tackles three key tasks: labeling individual components inside vision models, cleaning up image classifiers by removing irrelevant features, and hunting for hidden biases in AI systems [MIT News MAIA, 2024](https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-researchers-advance-automated-interpretability-ai-models-maia-0723).

### Novel Techniques

**Exploiting Shared Spaces**: One technique gaining popularity in multimodal interpretability is exploiting the shared text-image space of multimodal models, primarily applicable to models trained on contrastive loss between image and text, effectively providing "free" labels for the internal components of vision encoders [Sonia Joseph Multimodal Interpretability, 2024](https://www.soniajoseph.ai/multimodal-interpretability-in-2024/).

### Research Challenges

**Complexity and Scale**: The complexity and scale of MLLMs introduce significant challenges in interpretability and explainability, essential for establishing transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability in high-stakes applications [arXiv MLLM Interpretability Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.02104v1).

## 4. Attention Bottleneck Mechanisms (2024)

### Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer (MBT)

**Core Innovation**: The Multimodal Bottleneck Transformer (MBT) was introduced in "Attention Bottlenecks for Multimodal Fusion", published at NeurIPS 2021. This is a transformer-based architecture designed for multimodal fusion, particularly for video classification tasks combining vision and audio [arXiv Attention Bottlenecks, 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00135).

**Attention Bottlenecks**: The model introduces a small set of latent units that form an attention bottleneck, which force the model, within a given layer, to collate and condense information from each modality before sharing it with the other, while still allowing free attention flow within a modality [Google Research MBT, 2022](https://research.google/blog/multimodal-bottleneck-transformer-mbt-a-new-model-for-modality-fusion/).

**Two-Pronged Approach**: The model restricts cross-modal attention flow between latent units in two ways: (1) through tight fusion bottlenecks that force the model to collect and condense the most relevant inputs in each modality (sharing only necessary information with other modalities), and (2) to later layers of the model, allowing early layers to specialize to information from individual modalities [OpenReview MBT, 2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=KJ5h-yfUHa).

### Performance Benefits

**Efficiency Gains**: This approach achieves state-of-the-art results on video classification tasks, with a 50% reduction in FLOPs compared to a vanilla multimodal transformer model [Google Research MBT, 2022](https://research.google/blog/multimodal-bottleneck-transformer-mbt-a-new-model-for-modality-fusion/).

### Recent Applications (2024)

**MIABT for Sentiment Analysis**: A recent paper published in December 2024 in Multimedia Systems proposes a multilayer interactive attention bottleneck transformer (MIABT) network model for aspect-based multimodal sentiment analysis. This model includes a Multimodal Attention Bottleneck Transformer (MABT) module, which improves performance at lower computational costs by limiting the flow of information between modalities, only sharing necessary relevant information to restrict cross-modal attention [Springer MIABT, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00530-024-01601-8).

## 6. Contrastive Learning and Multimodal Alignment (2024)

### Recent Research Directions

**CoMM Framework (September 2024)**: This work introduces CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. By considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space, however this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities. CoMM proposes to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features [arXiv CoMM, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402).

**Data Augmentation Importance**: The paper references SimCLR augmentations (Chen et al., 2020a) and shows that strong data augmentation is crucial for learning multi-modal interactions [arXiv CoMM, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07402).

### Remote Sensing Applications

**Tripartite Relaxation Method (December 2024)**: A multimodal contrastive learning method for remote sensing image feature extraction was proposed, based on positive sample tripartite relaxation. This approach achieves multimodal alignment of various features by aligning semantic information with corresponding semantic regions in images [PMC Multimodal Contrastive Learning, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11644927/).

### Technical Foundations

**Intra-Modal and Cross-Modal Losses**: Frameworks like CLIP and ALIGN align embeddings across modalities, pushing the boundaries of multimodal contrastive learning. Intra-modal losses contrast augmented views within each modality, e.g., SimCLR-style [OpenReview CoMM, 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Pe3AxLq6Wf).

### Implementation Challenges

**Resource Requirements**: Methods like SimCLR need large batch sizes which makes it resource-heavy, while MoCo addresses this with a memory queue. Aligning multimodal data like text, audio, and images is complex [LearnOpenCV Contrastive Learning, 2024](https://learnopencv.com/contrastive-learning-simclr-and-byol-with-code-example/).

## 7. Model Compression and Efficiency Optimization (2024)

### Core Compression Techniques

**Three Main Approaches**: Model compression techniques include pruning, knowledge distillation, and quantization, which are essential for addressing the growing computational demands of AI models [Springer Model Compression Review, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-024-05747-w).

### Quantization Advances

**QLoRA Performance**: QLoRA reduces LLM weight precision to a 4-bit data type and backpropagates gradients to Low Rank Adapters (LoRA), achieving 99.3% of the original model's performance. PTQ can achieve nearly the same performance as the original model when quantizing weights to 4 bits [Nature Scientific Reports Compression, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07821-w).

**Knowledge Distillation**: Researchers have proposed knowledge distillation methods to distill large language models into smaller models, replacing the standard forward KLD objective with a reverse KLD objective to prevent the student model from overestimating low-probability regions [Springer Model Compression Review, 2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-024-05747-w).

### Multimodal-Specific Optimization

**NVIDIA Cosmos Tokenizers**: NVIDIA Cosmos tokenizers offer superior visual tokenization with high compression rates and reconstruction quality, enabling efficient training of large-scale generative models and delivering up to 12x faster reconstruction [NVIDIA NeMo Blog, 2024](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/state-of-the-art-multimodal-generative-ai-model-development-with-nvidia-nemo/).

### Environmental Impact

**Energy Reduction**: Model compression techniques are being investigated for reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions of transformer-based models without compromising performance. Applying model compression techniques resulted in a reduction in energy consumption of 32.097% for BERT with pruning [Nature Scientific Reports Compression, 2025](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07821-w).

### Market Growth

**Rapid Expansion**: The AI Model Compression market size reached USD 425.8 million in 2024 globally and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 27.6% during the forecast period, reaching a projected value of USD 3,832.1 million by 2033 [DataIntelo Market Report, 2024](https://dataintelo.com/report/ai-model-compression-market).

## 8. Zero-Shot Learning and Multimodal Transfer (2024)

### Foundational Concepts

**Transfer Learning Subset**: Zero-shot learning (ZSL), a subset of transfer learning, has emerged as an innovative solution to challenges in deep learning, focusing on classifying unseen categories present in the test set but absent during training. ZSL often leverages transfer learning to minimize the time and resources needed for training, as well the amount of auxiliary information needed to identify unseen classes [Sage Journals ZSL Review, 2024](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3233/IDT-240297).

### Multimodal Approaches

**Multi-Modal Learning**: Multi-modal learning has become increasingly popular due to its ability to leverage information from different data sources (e.g., text and images) to improve the model performance [Wikipedia Zero-Shot Learning, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-shot_learning).

**CLIP's Zero-Shot Capabilities**: CLIP has emerged as an effective approach that employs vision-language contrastive pretraining to learn joint image and text representations and exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot learning and text-guided natural image generation [OpenReview CLIP Understanding, 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S5yOuNfSA0).

### 2024 Applications

**Hand Gesture Recognition**: Multi-modal Zero-Shot Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition (ZS-DHGR) with no annotated visual examples, leveraging textual descriptions and harnessing complementary capabilities of deep features fused with skeleton-based ones [ScienceDirect Multi-modal ZSL, 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417424002148).

**Robotic Manipulation**: Novel robotic manipulation mechanisms leveraging large language models (LLMs) and multimodal zero-shot models, where manipulation strategies are generated as Python code that dynamically orchestrates visual and auditory models [PMC Robotic Framework, 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12375720/).

### Technical Methods

**Embedding-Based Approaches**: Embedding-based methods typically process auxiliary information and vector space embeddings of different forms of data, requiring normalization and projection to a shared high-dimensional semantic space for comparison [IBM Zero-Shot Learning, 2024](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/zero-shot-learning).

## 9. Vision-Language Pre-training Strategies (2024)

### Core Pre-training Objectives

**Contrastive Learning Dominance**: Contrastive learning is a commonly used pre-training objective for vision models and has proven to be a highly effective pre-training objective for vision-language models as well. The goal is to learn representations by maximizing the similarity between aligned image-text pairs while minimizing the similarity between mismatched ones [Hugging Face VL Pretraining, 2024](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining).

### Model Architecture Components

**Three Key Elements**: A vision-language model typically consists of 3 key elements: an image encoder, a text encoder, and a strategy to fuse information from the two encoders. These key elements are tightly coupled together as the loss functions are designed around both the model architecture and the learning strategy [Encord VLM Guide, 2024](https://encord.com/blog/vision-language-models-guide/).

### Primary Training Approaches

**1. Contrastive Learning**: Models like CLIP (Contrastive Language—Image Pre-training), LLaVa (Large Language and Vision Assistant), and Flamingo are tailored to healthcare domain through training on extensive medical datasets [Frontiers VLM Medical Review, 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1430984/full).

**2. PrefixLM**: Models such as SimVLM and VirTex use this pre-training objective and feature a unified multi-modal architecture consisting of a transformer encoder and transformer decoder, similar to that of an autoregressive language model [Hugging Face VL Pretraining, 2024](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining).

**3. Multi-modal Multi-task Masked Autoencoders**: MultiMAE differs from standard Masked Autoencoding in two key aspects: I) it can optionally accept additional modalities of information in the input besides the RGB image (hence "multi-modal"), and II) its training objective accordingly includes predicting multiple outputs besides the RGB image (hence "multi-task") [Hugging Face VL Pretraining, 2024](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining).

**4. Hybrid Approaches**: Works such as FLAVA use a combination of contrastive learning and other pretraining strategies to align vision and language embeddings [Viso AI VLM Guide, 2024](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/vision-language-models/).

### Recent Developments (2024)

**Interleaved Corpora**: Compared to image-text pair data, interleaved corpora enable Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand the world more naturally like humans. However, such existing datasets are crawled from webpage, facing challenges like low knowledge density, loose image-text relations, and poor logical coherence between images [arXiv 2.5 Years in Class, 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00958).

---

## 10. Multimodal Alignment Problem and Objective Mismatch (2024)

### Core Alignment Challenges

**Objective Misalignment**: Misaligned AI systems pursue unintended objectives, and it's challenging for designers to align AI because they struggle to specify the full range of desired and undesired behaviors. Proxy gaming is identified as a key problem where the helper model may not perfectly represent human feedback, allowing the main model to exploit this mismatch to gain more reward [Wikipedia AI Alignment, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment).

### Multimodal-Specific Issues

**Embedding Misalignment**: Misalignment across modalities has been identified as a primary source of errors and hallucinations in multimodal systems. Embedding misalignment means that a concept expressed in one modality doesn't correspond to the same concept in another modality within the model's latent space [Medium Gemini Inconsistencies, 2024](https://medium.com/@jabbalarajamohan/technical-report-multimodal-inconsistencies-in-google-gemini-9b15bcc81fb4).

**Intermodal Incoherence**: A mismatch between modalities or intermodal incoherence can lead to conflicts or ambiguities, with information from one source contradicting another. Combining data from multiple sources poses significant challenges due to differences in data format, timing, and interpretation [Cogito Tech Data Integration, 2024](https://www.cogitotech.com/blog/navigating-the-challenges-of-multimodal-ai-data-integration/).

### Research Developments (2024)

**Comprehensive Survey**: A November 2024 survey offers a comprehensive review of recent advancements in multimodal alignment and fusion within machine learning. Large-scale multimodal datasets from the Internet often contain mismatches between images and texts because these pairs are optimized for search engines rather than for precise multimodal alignment [arXiv Multimodal Alignment Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17040).

### Practical Solutions

**AlignRec Framework**: The AlignRec framework decomposes the recommendation objective into three alignments: alignment within contents, alignment between content and categorical ID, and alignment between users and items [ACM AlignRec, 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627673.3679626).

**Web-Scale Training**: Flamingo models can be trained on large-scale multimodal web corpora containing arbitrarily interleaved text and images, which is key to endow them with in-context few-shot learning capabilities [Google DeepMind Blog, 2024](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/tackling-multiple-tasks-with-a-single-visual-language-model/).

### Performance Achievements

**State-of-the-Art Results**: On numerous benchmarks, Flamingo outperforms models fine-tuned on thousands of times more task-specific data. Flamingo beats all previous few-shot learning approaches when given as few as four examples per task, and in several cases outperforms methods that are fine-tuned and optimized for each task independently [OpenReview Flamingo, 2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EbMuimAbPbs).

### Recent Adaptations (2024)

**Med-Flamingo**: Med-Flamingo, a multimodal few-shot learner adapted to the medical domain, was proposed based on OpenFlamingo-9B with continued pre-training on paired and interleaved medical image-text data [arXiv Med-Flamingo, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15189).

**Open Source Implementation**: OpenFlamingo is an open-source multimodal language model that can be used for a variety of tasks, providing an accessible implementation of the Flamingo architecture [GitHub OpenFlamingo, 2024](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo).

## 13. Multimodal Hallucination Detection and Mitigation (2024)

### Detection Approaches

**Black-Box vs White-Box**: Detection approaches are categorized into black-box methods that rely on model outputs and white-box approaches that leverage internal representations, which fall into three categories: attention-based detection, feature-based detection and logits-based detection [arXiv Multimodal Hallucination Survey, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.19024v1).

### Specific Detection Frameworks

### Current Challenges

**Retrieval-Augmented Systems**: Hallucinations in retrieval-augmented LLMs remain highly concerning, with multimodal extensions introducing additional factors that can lead to hallucinations, necessitating further research into mitigation strategies for multimodal retrieval-augmented LLMs [MDPI Hallucination Mitigation Review, 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/13/5/856).

**Benchmark Limitations**: Existing benchmarks often lack fine-grained and diagnostic assessments, and current automation methods are mostly limited to question generation with quality heavily dependent on human verification [ACM Hallucination Survey, 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3703155).

## 14. Modality Dropout and Robustness (2024)

### Dropout-Induced Modality Bias (CVPR 2024)

**Core Problem**: Advanced Audio-Visual Speech Recognition systems have been observed to be sensitive to missing video frames. While applying dropout techniques to the video modality enhances robustness to missing frames, it simultaneously results in performance loss when dealing with complete data input, with an excessive modality bias towards the audio modality induced by dropout constituting the fundamental cause [GitHub ModalBiasAVSR, 2024](https://github.com/dalision/ModalBiasAVSR).

**Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH)**: Researchers presented the Modality Bias Hypothesis (MBH) to systematically describe the relationship between modality bias and robustness against missing modality in multimodal systems, and proposed a novel Multimodal Distribution Approximation with Knowledge Distillation (MDA-KD) framework to reduce over-reliance on the audio modality [CVPR 2024 MBH Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Dai_A_Study_of_Dropout-Induced_Modality_Bias_on_Robustness_to_Missing_CVPR_2024_paper.html).

### Masked Modality Projection (MMP)

**Token-Level Masking**: Modality dropout augmentation, which randomly zeros out modalities, has shown robustness to missing modalities. This idea has been extended by masking out all the tokens of a random subset of modalities during each training iteration [arXiv MMP, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03010v1).

**Performance Improvements**: Experiments demonstrate that this approach improves robustness to different missing modality scenarios, outperforming existing methods designed for missing modalities or specific modality combinations [arXiv MMP, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.03010v1).

### Parameter-Efficient Adaptation

**Pretrained Model Robustness**: The performance of several existing multimodal networks significantly deteriorates if one or multiple modalities are absent at test time. To enable robustness to missing modalities, researchers proposed a simple and parameter-efficient adaptation procedure for pretrained multimodal networks [IEEE TPAMI Robust Multimodal Learning, 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TPAMI.2024.3476487).

### Cross-Modal Proxy Tokens (2024)

**Approximating Missing Modalities**: Multimodal models often experience significant performance drop when one or more modalities are missing during inference. A proposed approach introduces cross-modal proxy tokens (CMPTs), which approximate the class token of a missing modality by attending only to the tokens of the available modality [arXiv Robust Multimodal Learning, 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.17823v2).

### Key Insight

**Performance Trade-offs**: While modality dropout improves robustness to missing modalities, it often comes at the cost of performance degradation when all modalities are present—a key challenge the field is actively addressing through novel frameworks and training strategies in 2024 [arXiv Robust Multimodal Learning, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2310.03986v6).

## 15. Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Systems (2024)

### Sequential Compositional Generalization

**CompAct Dataset**: The paper "Sequential Compositional Generalization in Multimodal Models" introduces the CompAct dataset, a benchmark designed to test models' capacity for sequential compositional generalization, where they must learn to understand and apply language and visual concepts in new combinations [AI Models CompAct, 2024](https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/sequential-compositional-generalization-multimodal-models).

**Dataset Design**: The study examines sequential compositional generalization using CompAct (Compositional Activities), a carefully constructed, perceptually grounded dataset set within a rich backdrop of egocentric kitchen activity videos, with each instance represented by raw video footage, naturally occurring sound, and crowd-sourced step-by-step descriptions, ensuring individual concepts are consistently distributed across training and evaluation sets while their compositions are novel in the evaluation set [ACL Anthology CompAct, 2024](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.311/).

**Key Findings**: Their findings reveal that bi-modal and tri-modal models exhibit a clear edge over their text-only counterparts [AI Models CompAct, 2024](https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/sequential-compositional-generalization-multimodal-models).

### Systematic Generalization Challenges

**Transformer Limitations**: Research investigating Transformers' ability to perform implicit reasoning found that they can learn these skills only through "grokking", but struggle with systematic generalization in compositional tasks. These works highlight the challenges in achieving robust compositional reasoning with standard transformers [arXiv Neuroscience-Inspired Model, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.18868).

### Medical Imaging Applications

**Domain-Specific Challenges**: A December 2024 paper on compositional generalization of multimodal LLMs for medical imaging notes that multimodal large language models hold significant potential in the medical field, but their capabilities are often limited by insufficient data in certain medical domains [arXiv MLLM Medical Imaging, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20070).

### Broader Implications

**Path to AGI**: The multimodal large language model represented by GPT-4V has been a new rising research hotspot, with surprising emergent capabilities such as writing stories based on images and optical character recognition–free math reasoning, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence [Oxford Academic MLLM Survey, 2024](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/article/11/12/nwae403/7896414).
