**Answer:** ✅ YES - EXTENSIVELY

**Top 5 Studies Validating Concept:**

1. **Confidence Alignment (CHI 2025)**
   - [Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713336)
   - Finding: "Users' self-confidence aligns with AI confidence and persists after AI removed"
   - Asymmetry: "Humans misattribute blame to themselves, rely on poorly performing AI"

2. **Metacognitive Sensitivity (PNAS Nexus 2025)**
   - [Link](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/5/pgaf133/8118889)
   - Finding: "AI confidence increases human trust even when AI is wrong"
   - Asymmetry: "Humans struggle to accurately assess own confidence"

3. **AI Memory Gap (arXiv 2024)**
   - [Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11851)
   - Finding: "Working with AI systematically impairs source attribution"
   - Asymmetry: "Confidence exceeded actual accuracy" (feel right while being wrong)

4. **False Memories (MIT/CHI 2025)**
   - [Link](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.08895v1)
   - Finding: "AI induces 3x more false memories (36.4%)"

### 3. Cognitive Mechanisms Findings

**Question:** WHY does this asymmetry occur?
**Answer:** ✅ 8 MAJOR MECHANISMS IDENTIFIED

**Primary Mechanisms (Strongest Evidence):**

1. **Metacognitive Miscalibration** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
   - Humans poor at self-assessment
   - AI provides confident external signal
   - External confidence replaces internal uncertainty

2. **Cognitive Effort Minimization** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
   - Self-assessment cognitively costly
   - AI acceptance effortless
   - Rational to trust AI (minimizes effort)

3. **Source Memory Interference** (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
   - Cannot distinguish own ideas from AI's
   - False memories with high confidence
   - Default to AI attribution when uncertain

**Secondary Mechanisms:**

4. **Attribution Asymmetry** (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
5. **Anthropomorphic Trust Transfer** (⭐⭐⭐⭐)
6. **Epistemic Deference** (⭐⭐⭐⭐)

**Tertiary Mechanisms:**

7. **Cognitive Debt Accumulation** (⭐⭐⭐)
8. **Fluency Heuristic** (⭐⭐⭐)

**Self-Reinforcing Cycle:**
```
Poor Metacognition → AI Provides Alternative → Trust AI →
Cognitive Offloading → Skills Atrophy → Objective Self-Trust Decline →
Memory Confusion → False Memories → Attribution Bias →
INCREASED ASYMMETRY (cycle amplifies)
```

### 4. Related Frameworks Findings

**Question:** How does "trust asymmetry" relate to established research?
**Answer:** ✅ BUILDS ON + INTEGRATES existing frameworks

**Three Major Frameworks:**

**Automation Bias** (1990s-present)
- Over-reliance on automated systems
- Evidence: 20+ years, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Relationship: Trust asymmetry explains WHY automation bias occurs

**Algorithm Appreciation** (2019-present)
- Preferring AI advice over human advice
- Evidence: Recent but robust, ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Relationship: Trust asymmetry adds metacognitive + affective dimension

**Trust Calibration** (2015-present)
- Matching reliance to capability
- Evidence: Well-developed, ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Relationship: Trust asymmetry highlights COMPARATIVE calibration (self vs AI)

**Novel Contribution of "Trust Asymmetry":**
- Adds self-doubt dimension (not just AI over-trust)
- Metacognitive + memory + affective components
- Comparative framing (self-trust vs AI-trust explicitly contrasted)
- Integrative concept spanning behavioral, cognitive, affective domains

## Blog Post Recommendations

### ✅ Approved Framing Options

**Option 1: Coin New Term (Recommended)**
> "I call this **metacognitive trust asymmetry** - the gap between how critically we assess ourselves and how uncritically we accept AI. Building on decades of automation bias research and recent metacognitive studies, this pattern reveals..."

**Option 2: Descriptive Phrase**
> "Recent research reveals a striking pattern: we question ourselves but not AI. Across 60+ studies..."

**Option 3: Anchor in Established Research**
> "Combining automation bias, algorithm appreciation, and metacognitive misalignment, researchers have identified a troubling pattern..."

### ✅ Must-Cite Studies (Choose 3-5)

4. **[AI Over-Reliance (CHB 2024)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563224002206)** - Override own judgment
5. **[False Memories (MIT/CHI 2025)](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.08895v1)** - Memory interference

### ✅ Safe Claims (Well-Supported)

- ✅ "Research shows humans question own judgment while trusting AI"
- ✅ "We can't distinguish our ideas from AI's after collaboration"
- ✅ "AI creates false memories with higher confidence than real ones"
- ✅ "People follow AI advice even when their own judgment is correct"
- ✅ "71% of CEOs report impostor syndrome due to AI"
- ✅ "Driven by metacognition, memory confusion, cognitive offloading"

### ❌ Avoid Claims (Not Supported)

- ❌ "Trust asymmetry is established cognitive science term"
- ❌ "This is a new discovery"
- ❌ "Everyone experiences this equally"
- ❌ "All AI use causes this pattern"
