# Component 4: Related Frameworks - Automation Bias, Algorithm Appreciation, Trust Calibration

## Research Question
What established research frameworks best describe the "trust asymmetry" phenomenon? How do algorithm appreciation, automation bias, and trust calibration relate to our concept?

## Executive Summary

**Three major research frameworks directly relate to the phenomenon:**

1. **Automation Bias** (20+ years, extensive literature) - Over-reliance on automated systems
2. **Algorithm Appreciation/Aversion** (2019-present) - Preferring or rejecting algorithmic advice
3. **Trust Calibration** (2015-present) - Matching reliance to system capability

**Key Finding:** The proposed "trust asymmetry" concept is **NOVEL in its specific framing** (self-doubt + AI trust) but **builds on established frameworks** that provide validation and theoretical grounding.

## PART 1: Automation Bias Framework

### 1.1 Definition and Historical Context

**Foundational Definition:**
"Automation bias is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct" [Oxford Academic, 2023](https://academic.oup.com/jpart/article/33/1/153/6524536)

**Historical Development:**
- **Early research (1990s-2000s):** Aviation and medical systems
- **Systematic review (2003):** First comprehensive analysis
- **AI era (2020-present):** Application to machine learning systems

---

### 1.2 Core Automation Bias Research

**Study 1: Systematic Review - PMC (2003/Updated 2024)**
- **Citation:** [Automation bias: a systematic review of frequency, effect mediators, and mitigators](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3240751/)
- **Scope:** Comprehensive review of automation bias literature
- **Key Findings:**

**Two Types of Automation Bias Errors:**

1. **Commission Errors:**
   - "Occur when users follow an automated directive without taking into account other sources of information"
   - Accepting AI advice **despite contradictory evidence**
   - **Relates to trust asymmetry:** Trusting AI over own knowledge

2. **Omission Errors:**
   - "Occur when automated devices fail to detect or indicate problems and the user does not notice because they are not properly monitoring the system"
   - **Relates to trust asymmetry:** Not monitoring AI because you assume it's correct

**Three Cognitive Mechanisms:**

1. **Cognitive Miser Hypothesis:** "The human tendency to choose the least cognitive approach to decision-making"
2. **Perceived Superiority:** "The tendency of humans to view automated aids as having an analytical ability superior to their own"
3. **Effort Reduction:** "The tendency of humans to reduce their own effort when sharing tasks"

**Mediating Factors Identified:**

| Factor Type | Specific Factors | Effect on Bias |
|------------|------------------|----------------|
| User Factors | Cognitive style, experience | Moderate bias |
| Attitudinal | Trust, confidence | Amplify bias |
| Environmental | Workload, time pressure | Increase bias |

**Critical Nuance:**
- Automation bias is **context-dependent**, not universal
- Sometimes see **algorithm aversion** instead
- **Relevance to trust asymmetry:** The asymmetry may depend on task, domain, and individual factors

---

### 1.4 How Automation Bias Relates to "Trust Asymmetry"

**Overlapping Components:**
- ✅ Over-reliance on AI (core of automation bias)
- ✅ Ignoring own contradictory information (commission errors)
- ✅ Cognitive effort reduction (mechanism)

**Novel Components in "Trust Asymmetry":**
- ⭐ **Self-doubt dimension** (automation bias doesn't emphasize questioning self)
- ⭐ **Memory/source confusion** (not part of traditional automation bias)
- ⭐ **Metacognitive alignment** (recent addition, not in classic framework)

**Relationship:**
- Automation bias = **behavioral pattern** (over-reliance)
- Trust asymmetry = **cognitive/affective pattern** (self-doubt + AI trust)
- **Trust asymmetry could be the MECHANISM underlying automation bias**

---

## PART 2: Algorithm Appreciation and Aversion

### 2.1 Defining the Spectrum

**Core Concepts:**

**Algorithm Aversion:**
- "The preference for humans over algorithms in decision-making" [MIS Quarterly, 2024]
- Rejecting algorithmic advice even when superior

**Algorithm Appreciation:**
- "The preference for algorithmic advice over human advice"
- Trusting algorithms more than humans (including self)

**Key Insight:** These are **not opposites** but different phenomena occurring in different contexts

---

### 2.2 Major Algorithm Appreciation Research

**Study 6: Integrative Perspective - MIS Quarterly (2024)**
- **Citation:** [An Integrative Perspective on Algorithm Aversion and Appreciation in Decision-Making](https://misq.umn.edu/an-integrative-perspective-on-algorithm-aversion-and-appreciation-in-decision-making.html)

|----------------------|------------------------|
| Prefer AI advice over human advice | Prefer AI judgment over own judgment |
| Focus: **choice behavior** | Focus: **confidence/self-assessment** |
| Doesn't emphasize self-doubt | **Emphasizes self-doubt** as mechanism |
| Comparative (AI vs humans generally) | **Personal** (AI vs self specifically) |

**Novel Contribution of "Trust Asymmetry":**
- Algorithm appreciation: "I choose AI over human advice"
- Trust asymmetry: "I **doubt myself** and **trust AI**, creating asymmetric confidence"
- **Adds affective and metacognitive dimensions**

---

## PART 3: Trust Calibration Framework

### 3.1 Defining Appropriate Trust

**Core Concept:**
"Trust calibration is defined as the relation between user reliance and system reliability" [Multiple sources]

**Appropriate Trust:**
- Trust level matches actual system capability
- Neither over-trust nor under-trust
- **Dynamic adjustment** as performance observed

---

### 3.2 Major Trust Calibration Research

**Study 11: Adaptive Trust Calibration - PLOS One (2020)**
- **Citation:** [Adaptive trust calibration for human-AI collaboration](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0229132)
- **Key Contribution:** Framework for **detecting and correcting** inappropriate trust

**Three Calibration States:**

1. **Appropriate Trust:**
   - Reliance matches capability
   - Optimal performance

2. **Over-Trust:**
   - Reliance exceeds capability
   - **Commission errors** (accepting bad advice)

3. **Under-Trust:**
   - Reliance below capability
   - **Omission errors** (rejecting good advice)

**Adaptive Calibration:**
- System detects calibration state
- Provides interventions (transparency cues, uncertainty information)
- Goal: **Move toward appropriate trust**

**Relevance to Trust Asymmetry:**
- "Trust asymmetry" = specific type of **over-trust in AI** + **under-trust in self**
- Calibration framework provides **normative standard** (what trust should be)
- Trust asymmetry describes **deviation pattern** (how people actually calibrate)

---

**Study 12: Systematic Review - ACM Responsible Computing (2024)**
- **Citation:** [A Systematic Review on Fostering Appropriate Trust in Human-AI Interaction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3696449)
- **Scope:** Comprehensive review of trust calibration approaches
- **Key Finding:** "One of the major reasons of disuse and misuse of AI is people's over- or under-trust in it, or in other words, lack of appropriate trust in AI"

**Major Approaches Reviewed:**

1. **Transparency:** Show AI uncertainty, limitations
2. **Explanations:** XAI to enable trust calibration
3. **Confidence Scores:** Communicate AI confidence
4. **Performance Feedback:** Show when AI is right/wrong
5. **Adaptive Systems:** Personalize trust calibration

**Critical Gap Identified:**
- "Research in detecting and mitigating improper trust calibration remains very limited"
- Most research on **system-level** trust, not **comparative trust** (self vs AI)
- **Trust asymmetry addresses this gap:** comparative trust calibration

---

**Study 13: XAI and Trust Calibration - World Wide Web Journal (2021)**
- **Citation:** [Explainable recommendation: when design meets trust calibration](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11280-021-00916-0)
- **Focus:** How explanation design affects trust calibration

**Five Design Principles:**

1. **Design for engagement:** Keep users actively involved
2. **Challenge habitual actions:** Prevent automation bias
3. **Attention guidance:** Direct focus to important information
4. **Friction:** Slow down over-reliant decisions
5. **Support training and learning:** Build calibration skills

**Relevance to Trust Asymmetry:**
- Principles assume people **over-trust AI**
- None address **under-trusting self**
- **Trust asymmetry framework adds:** need to calibrate **self-trust** upward, not just AI-trust downward

### 3.3 Metacognitive Trust Calibration (Emerging)

**Study 14: Metacognitive Sensitivity - PNAS Nexus (2025)**
- **Citation:** [Metacognitive sensitivity: The key to calibrating trust and optimal decision making with AI](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/5/pgaf133/8118889)
- **Novel Contribution:** Focus on **AI metacognitive sensitivity** (not just accuracy)

**Key Insight:**
- "An AI with lower predictive accuracy but higher metacognitive sensitivity can enhance the overall accuracy of human decision making"
- **What matters:** AI's ability to know when it's right vs wrong (metacognitive sensitivity)

**Mechanism:**
- High metacognitive sensitivity = AI expresses **high confidence when correct**, **low confidence when wrong**
- Helps humans **calibrate trust appropriately**
- Poor metacognitive sensitivity = misleads humans about when to trust

**Relevance to Trust Asymmetry:**
- Current AI (especially LLMs) often has **poor metacognitive sensitivity**
- Expresses high confidence even when wrong
- Creates **miscalibrated human trust** (over-trust)
- Compounds self-trust problems (if AI is confident, I must be wrong)

---

**Study 15: Human Self-Confidence Calibration - arXiv (2024)**
- **Citation:** [Are You Really Sure? Understanding the Effects of Human Self-Confidence Calibration](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.09552v1)
- **Focus:** How human self-confidence calibration affects AI reliance

**Key Finding:**
- "If people could accurately perceive their abilities and calibrate self-confidence accordingly, the collaboration between humans and AI will be more successful"
- But: "It is difficult for humans to maintain a 'calibrated' self-confidence"

**Two-Way Calibration Problem:**

1. **AI Trust Calibration:** Match reliance on AI to AI capability (traditional focus)
2. **Self-Trust Calibration:** Match confidence in self to actual self capability (**under-researched**)

**Trust Asymmetry Contribution:**
- Highlights **both need calibration**
- Problem: Over-trust AI + Under-trust self = double miscalibration
- Solution requires **dual intervention**

| Intervention: adjust AI reliance | Intervention: adjust **both** AI trust and self-trust |
| Assumes rational agents | Accounts for cognitive biases |

**Novel Contribution:**
- Trust calibration: "Trust AI appropriately"
- Trust asymmetry: "Trust AI appropriately **relative to self**"
- Adds **comparative dimension**
