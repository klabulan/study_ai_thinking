## FINDING: Terminology Exists BUT With Different Meaning

### 1. "Trust Asymmetry" IS Used in Academic Literature

**The term "trust asymmetry" DOES appear** in recent human-AI interaction research, but with a **different conceptual meaning** than the proposed blog post framing.

#### Academic Usage of "Trust Asymmetry"

**Source 1: Frontiers in Psychology (2024)**
- **Citation:** [Developing trustworthy artificial intelligence: insights from research on interpersonal, human-automation, and human-AI trust](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1382693/full)
- **Usage:** "Power asymmetry often results in trust asymmetry, and interactions with AI-driven technologies may engender a perceived sense of power or dominance among users."
- **Meaning:** Trust asymmetry refers to **power imbalances** between humans and AI systems, not differential self-trust vs AI-trust
- **Context:** Discusses how power dynamics (not cognitive mechanisms) create unequal trust relationships

**Source 2: PMC Article (2024)**
- **Citation:** [Developing trustworthy artificial intelligence: insights from research on interpersonal, human-automation, and human-AI trust - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11061529/)
- **Usage:** "From a dyadic perspective, interpersonal trust can be categorized into three types: reciprocal trust, highlighting the dynamic interactions between parties; mutual trust, reflecting a shared and consistent level of trust; and asymmetric trust, indicating imbalances in trust levels within interpersonal relationships."
- **Meaning:** "Asymmetric trust" describes **unequal trust between two parties** (e.g., Party A trusts Party B more than B trusts A)
- **Context:** Applied to human-AI relationships as dyadic (two-party) trust dynamics, NOT about humans questioning themselves vs trusting AI

**Source 3: Automation Trust Research**
- **Citation:** Multiple sources on automation trust calibration
- **Usage:** "Asymmetrical reliability attribution in automated systems"
- **Meaning:** How users calibrate trust over time based on system performance asymmetries
- **Context:** System reliability perception, not human self-doubt mechanisms

## 2. What "Trust Asymmetry" DOES NOT Mean in Current Literature

The academic literature does **NOT use "trust asymmetry"** to describe:
- Humans questioning their own memory while trusting AI memory
- Differential confidence in human vs AI judgment
- The phenomenon of self-doubt paired with AI over-reliance
- Metacognitive asymmetry (human uncertainty vs AI confidence perception)

---

## 3. Critical Distinction

### Existing Academic Meaning
- **Trust asymmetry** = unequal trust levels **between** human and AI (directional imbalance)
- Example: Human trusts AI at level 8/10, AI "trusted by" human at level 8/10, but no reciprocal trust from AI to human
- Focus: **Relational power dynamics**

### Proposed Blog Post Meaning
- **"Trust asymmetry"** = humans question **themselves** more than they question **AI**
- Example: Human doubts own memory (low self-trust) while accepting AI memory (high AI-trust)
- Focus: **Cognitive self-assessment asymmetry**

## 6. Terminology Verdict

### ❌ "Trust Asymmetry" as Proposed = NOT Established Terminology

**Specific Finding:**
- The exact phrase "trust asymmetry" **exists** in academic literature
- It means something **different** from the blog post's intended concept
- No academic sources found using it to describe "humans question themselves but trust AI"

### ⚠️ Risk of Terminological Confusion

**If blog post uses "trust asymmetry":**
- Readers familiar with academic literature will expect power dynamics discussion
- May create confusion between established meaning (power imbalance) and proposed meaning (self-doubt vs AI trust)
- Could undermine credibility if presented as established cognitive science term

## 7. Alternative Established Terms That BETTER Describe the Concept

While "trust asymmetry" doesn't describe the proposed phenomenon, the **concept itself IS well-documented** under different names (see Component 2 for full analysis):

### Terms Found in Literature:
1. **Automation Bias** - tendency to over-rely on automated systems
2. **Algorithm Appreciation** - preferring AI judgment over human judgment
3. **Metacognitive Misalignment** - AI confidence affecting human self-confidence
4. **Cognitive Offloading** - delegating memory/judgment to external systems
5. **Self-Trust Degradation** - decreased confidence in own abilities when AI is present
6. **Epistemic Deference** - deferring to AI as epistemic authority

---

## 8. Recommendation for Blog Post

### Option A: Coin New Term (Risky)
- Use "trust asymmetry" as **novel framing**
- **Required:** Explicitly state it's not established terminology
- **Required:** Distinguish from existing academic usage
- **Risk:** Confusion, reduced credibility

### Option B: Use Established Framework (Safer)
- Frame as "**metacognitive confidence asymmetry**" or "**self-trust vs AI-trust differential**"
- Build on existing research (automation bias + metacognitive sensitivity)
- **Advantage:** Academic backing, clearer meaning
- **Evidence Strength:** STRONG (see Component 2)

### Option C: Descriptive Phrase (Clearest)
- "The phenomenon where we question ourselves but not AI"
- No claim to formal terminology
- Focus on observable behavior
- **Advantage:** Accessible, accurate, no false academic authority

## Conclusion: Terminology Validation

**VERDICT: "Trust Asymmetry" is NOT established terminology for the proposed concept**

- ✅ Term exists in literature
- ❌ Means something different (power dynamics, not self-doubt)
- ✅ **Concept exists** under different names (strong evidence)
- ⚠️ Using term requires careful framing to avoid confusion

**Next Steps:**
- See Component 2 for conceptual evidence under correct terminology
