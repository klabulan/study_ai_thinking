## Research Gap Identification: Academic Context

### What Academic Literature IS Addressing

✅ **Theoretical mechanisms** of human-AI bias feedback loops
✅ **Experimental validation** of bias amplification across domains
✅ **Cross-disciplinary applications** (psychology, CS, business, medical)
✅ **Methodological frameworks** for studying human-AI interaction bias

### What Academic Literature IS NOT Yet Addressing

❌ **Practical mitigation frameworks** grounded in cognitive mechanisms
❌ **Longitudinal studies** of bias amplification over extended periods
❌ **Intervention effectiveness** studies testing bias reduction strategies
❌ **Individual difference factors** (who is most susceptible to bias amplification?)
❌ **Cultural variation** in human-AI feedback loop dynamics

## Implications for Content Strategy

### Academic Citation Pattern Suggests:

1. **Research is being rapidly integrated** into academic discourse
   - 72 citations in 4 weeks = foundational status emerging
   - Cross-disciplinary interest = broad applicability

2. **Practitioner gap remains** despite academic uptake
   - Citations are primarily academic, not applied
   - Opportunity for translational content bridging research-practice gap

3. **Mechanism explanation is valued**
   - Citing papers emphasize feedback loop concept
   - Clear, accessible mechanism explanation resonates

4. **Applied frameworks are needed**
   - Citations show theoretical application, not practical implementation
   - Opportunity to create actionable guidance based on research
