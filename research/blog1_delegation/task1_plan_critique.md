# Critical Evaluation: Task 1 Research Plan

## Plan Strengths

**✅ Good:**
1. Comprehensive source taxonomy (6 major types)
2. Clear evaluation criteria (5-dimension scoring)
3. Explicit risk mitigation strategies
4. Verification protocols defined
5. Output specifications detailed

## Critical Flaws & Improvements Needed

### FLAW 1: Unrealistic "Perfect Case" Expectations

**Problem:**
Plan seeks ONE perfect case scoring 22+/25 across all dimensions. This is likely unrealistic:
- 2024-2025 is very recent (limited documentation)
- Companies rarely publish detailed failure postmortems
- "Confidence increased" metric is rarely explicitly tracked/reported
- Academic case studies have 6-12 month publication lag

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- No acknowledgment that "perfect case" may not exist
- Backup plans feel like afterthoughts
- May waste hours searching for unicorn

**Improvement:**
✅ **Revised Strategy: "Strong Core + Enhancement Pattern"**

Instead of seeking all elements in ONE case:
- **Find strong 2024-2025 failure case** (15-18/25 acceptable)
- **Enhance with supporting evidence** from related sources for missing elements
- **Composite narrative explicitly disclosed** if needed

**Revised Minimum Viable Case:**
- ✅ 2024-2025 failure with named org/AI system (required)
- ✅ Quantified impact (required)
- ✅ Citeable source (required)
- ⚠️ "Best practices" evidence (can be inferred from industry standards)
- ⚠️ "Confidence increased" (can be supported by separate research on AI trust calibration)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Core case: 15+/25 (reduced from 18)
- Enhanced narrative with supporting sources: functional equivalent to 20+/25

---

### FLAW 2: Over-Reliance on Company Postmortems

**Problem:**
Plan assumes companies publish honest failure postmortems. Reality:
- Legal liability prevents detailed public postmortems
- Most failures are confidential
- Public "lessons learned" posts are sanitized

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Company engineering blogs listed as primary source
- No acknowledgment of legal/PR constraints
- Verification process assumes public documentation

**Improvement:**
✅ **Revised Source Hierarchy:**

**Tier 1 (Most Likely to Find):**
- Academic case studies (anonymized but detailed)
- Investigative journalism (third-party investigation)
- Regulatory reports (FTC, EU, industry regulators)

**Tier 2 (Possible but Limited):**
- Industry reports with verified examples (McKinsey, Gartner)
- AI safety research with deployment case studies

**Tier 3 (Least Likely, but Check):**
- Company postmortems (if they exist, gold mine)
- Conference talks/papers with real-world examples

**Adjusted Expectations:**
- Primary search: Academic literature + journalism (not company blogs)
- Company postmortems: bonus if found, not baseline expectation
- Anonymous cases: acceptable IF sufficient detail

---

### FLAW 3: "2025 Only" Temporal Bias

**Problem:**
Plan strongly prefers 2025 cases. Issues:
- We're in early 2025 (limited publication lag time)
- Best documented cases may be late 2024
- Academic publications have 6-12 month lag
- Journalism investigations take 2-4 months

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- "Ideally 2025" preference throughout
- May miss excellent 2024 cases
- No acknowledgment of publication lag

**Improvement:**
✅ **Revised Temporal Strategy:**

**Acceptable Timeframe: Q3 2024 - Present**
- Incidents from late 2024 are "2025 relevant" (recent capabilities)
- Publication date can be 2024 if incident is recent
- Focus on "current AI capabilities era" not calendar year

**Prioritization:**
1. Incidents involving 2024-2025 AI models (GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini)
2. Incidents demonstrating current delegation challenges
3. Calendar date less important than AI capability era

**2025 Urgency Can Still Be Established:**
- "In 2024-2025, as AI capabilities reached X..."
- "As organizations deployed [current-gen models]..."
- Focus on capability shift, not calendar year

---

### FLAW 4: Search Query Naivety

**Problem:**
Query list assumes cases are labeled "AI deployment failure" or "AI incident postmortem". Reality:
- Companies don't label things "failure" in titles
- Best cases may be embedded in broader narratives
- Academic papers use different terminology

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Direct queries like "AI deployment failure"
- No oblique or domain-specific queries
- Assumes self-labeling

**Improvement:**
✅ **Revised Query Strategy:**

**Oblique Queries (More Likely to Find Real Cases):**
- "AI implementation lessons learned 2024"
- "challenges deploying AI in production"
- "when AI doesn't work as expected"
- "AI system retirement" (implies failure)
- "AI adoption roadblocks"

**Domain-Specific Incident Queries:**
- "chatbot inappropriate response" (customer service AI)
- "AI coding assistant security vulnerability"
- "medical AI false negative"
- "AI content moderation failure"
- "recommendation system bias incident"

**Regulatory/Legal Angle:**
- "FTC AI investigation"
- "EU AI Act enforcement"
- "AI discrimination complaint"
- "algorithmic accountability case"

**Academic Paper Queries:**
- "AI deployment case study CHI 2024"
- "human-AI collaboration challenges CSCW"
- "AI adoption failure factors"
- "trust calibration breakdown"

**Journalism Angle:**
- [Company name] + "AI" + "problem/issue/concern" 2024
- "AI went wrong" site:wired.com OR site:arstechnica.com
- Investigation terminology, not "postmortem"

---

### FLAW 5: Scoring System Over-Engineering

**Problem:**
5-dimension scoring with 1-5 scales (25 total) is complex and subjective:
- How to consistently score "retellability" 3 vs 4?
- Scoring takes time, may not improve decision
- Implies false precision

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Elaborate scoring rubric without calibration examples
- No inter-rater reliability (single researcher)
- Time investment vs value unclear

**Improvement:**
✅ **Simplified Binary Checklist:**

**Must-Have (Any missing = reject):**
- [ ] 2024-2025 timeframe
- [ ] Specific AI system identified
- [ ] Quantified impact
- [ ] Citeable source (Tier 1-2)
- [ ] Retellable in 200 words

**Nice-to-Have (Optimize for):**
- [ ] Named organization
- [ ] Explicit "best practices" evidence
- [ ] "Confidence increased" documentation
- [ ] Multiple comparison table dimensions exposed
- [ ] Strong paradox clarity

**Decision Rule:**
- 5/5 must-haves + 3+/5 nice-to-haves = strong candidate
- Compare top 3-5 candidates qualitatively, not numerically
- Select based on narrative power + comparison table setup

**Time Saved:** 30-45 minutes (scoring complexity reduced)

---

### FLAW 6: Insufficient Backup Plan

**Problem:**
Plan's risk mitigation assumes "strong case exists somewhere." But what if:
- No 2024-2025 cases meet minimum criteria?
- All strong cases are confidential?
- Best available case is weak on "confidence increased" dimension?

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- "Will NOT composite without clear disclosure" is too rigid
- No clear threshold for "good enough"
- Assumes perfect case exists

**Improvement:**
✅ **Tiered Backup Strategy:**

**Plan A: Strong Single Case (Preferred)**
- 2024-2025, all must-haves, 3+ nice-to-haves
- Narrative as drafted in plan

**Plan B: Strong Case + Supporting Evidence**
- 2024-2025 case with 5/5 must-haves, 1-2 nice-to-haves
- Add supporting evidence for missing elements:
  - "Best practices" element: cite industry standards
  - "Confidence increased": cite separate research on AI trust over time
- Narrative: "In [case], [failure occurred]. Research shows this pattern is common: [citation]."

**Plan C: Composite Narrative (Disclosed)**
- 2-3 related 2024-2025 cases
- Combine to illustrate pattern
- Explicit framing: "Three incidents in 2024 illustrate the pattern..."
- All cases individually cited

**Plan D: Strong 2023-2024 Case (Fallback)**
- Use best-documented case even if late 2023
- Establish 2025 urgency through separate evidence (Task 7 research)
- Frame as: "This 2023 pattern has accelerated in 2025..."

**Red Line:**
- Will NOT fabricate details
- Will NOT use unverified anecdotes
- Will clearly disclose if using composite or older case

**Decision Criteria:**
- Spend max 3 hours seeking Plan A
- If not found, move to Plan B (don't waste time on perfect case)
- Plan C only if A and B both fail
- Plan D is acceptable (better to have strong older case than weak recent case)

---

### FLAW 7: Verification Overkill

**Problem:**
4-step verification process for each candidate is time-intensive:
- May spend 20-30 minutes per candidate
- With 10-20 candidates, this is 3-6 hours
- Verification should be tiered (quick filter, then deep dive)

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Same verification depth for all candidates
- No quick rejection criteria
- Timeline (45-60 min verification) assumes only top 3 verified

**Improvement:**
✅ **Tiered Verification Process:**

**Tier 1: Quick Filter (2-3 minutes per candidate)**
- Is source citeable? (URL exists, not broken)
- Is timeframe 2024-2025?
- Is AI system mentioned?
- Does it describe a failure/problem?
- **Decision:** Pass/Reject for deeper evaluation

**Tier 2: Mid-Depth Check (5-10 minutes for passed candidates)**
- Read full article/paper
- Confirm quantified impact exists
- Check source quality (Tier 1-2 in hierarchy?)
- Assess retellability
- **Decision:** Top 5 candidates for deep verification

**Tier 3: Deep Verification (15-20 minutes for top 3-5)**
- Full 4-step verification process from original plan
- Draft test opening hook
- Cross-reference with other sources
- Evaluate comparison table setup
- **Decision:** Select final case

**Time Savings:**
- Original: 4-step process for 10-20 candidates = 3-6 hours
- Revised: Tiered process = 0.5-1 hour (filter) + 0.5 hour (mid) + 0.75 hour (deep) = 1.75-2.25 hours

---

### FLAW 8: Missing "Paradox Test"

**Problem:**
Plan evaluates "paradox clarity" but doesn't test it:
- Will reader experience cognitive dissonance?
- Does the case challenge "common sense" delegation?
- Is the paradox intellectually satisfying?

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Scoring dimension exists but no test methodology
- Assumes evaluator can assess objectively
- No reader perspective check

**Improvement:**
✅ **Paradox Test Protocol:**

For each top candidate, write 2-sentence paradox statement:

**Template:**
"[Organization] deployed [AI system] for [task]. They did [best practice 1], [best practice 2], and [best practice 3]. [Timeframe] later, [bad outcome]. But [confidence/trust/success metric] actually IMPROVED. The problem wasn't the AI—it was treating AI like a human employee."

**Test Questions:**
1. Does this create "wait, WHAT?" reaction?
2. Does it challenge common-sense delegation wisdom?
3. Does it make reader want to know "how did this happen?"
4. Does it naturally lead to "we need a different framework"?

**Scoring:**
- 4/4 yes: Excellent paradox
- 3/4 yes: Good paradox
- 2/4 yes: Weak paradox (probably won't work)

**Apply to top 3-5 candidates before final selection.**

---

### FLAW 9: No "Explanation Readiness" Check

**Problem:**
Plan focuses on finding case but doesn't check if failure mechanism is explainable:
- Some AI failures are genuinely mysterious (black box)
- Can't use case if we can't explain WHY it failed
- Comparison table setup requires clear mechanism

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- No requirement that failure mechanism is understood
- "Black-box failures" mentioned but not addressed
- May select case that can't be explained

**Improvement:**
✅ **Explanation Readiness Checklist:**

For top candidates, verify:
- [ ] Failure mechanism is documented (not just "AI failed")
- [ ] Mechanism connects to comparison table dimension
- [ ] Can be explained in 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Doesn't require deep technical knowledge to understand
- [ ] Makes sense to non-AI-expert reader

**Example GOOD mechanism:**
"AI confidently misinterpreted ambiguous instructions, never signaled confusion, human reviewers trusted the confident tone and approved incorrect outputs."
→ Connects to "Task Understanding" dimension, explainable, clear

**Example BAD mechanism:**
"AI experienced capability cliff due to distributional shift in production environment."
→ Too technical, not clearly connected to delegation framework issue

**Apply before final selection—explainable mechanism is must-have.**

---

### FLAW 10: Timeline Optimism

**Problem:**
Plan estimates 2.5-4 hours total. Reality checks:
- Finding 10-20 candidates may take longer (reading time)
- Deep reading of academic papers is slow
- Following citation chains takes time
- 3-4 hours is optimistic

**Evidence of Flaw:**
- Phase A: "60-90 minutes for 10-20 candidates" = 3-4.5 min per candidate (unrealistic for academic papers)
- Assumes efficient search with immediate hits
- No buffer for dead ends

**Improvement:**
✅ **Revised Realistic Timeline:**

**Phase A (Wide Search): 90-120 minutes**
- 30 min: Execute queries, compile source list
- 60-90 min: Quick read/filter (Tier 1 verification)
- Target: 8-15 candidates passing filter

**Phase B (Mid-Depth Evaluation): 45-60 minutes**
- 10 min per top candidate (5-6 candidates)
- Binary checklist evaluation
- Target: 3-5 strong candidates

**Phase C (Deep Verification): 45-60 minutes**
- 15-20 min per top candidate (3 candidates)
- Full verification + paradox test + explanation check
- Target: 1-2 finalists

**Phase D (Final Selection): 15-30 minutes**
- Write test opening hooks for finalists
- Select best + document rationale
- Prepare backup

**Buffer for Challenges: +30-60 minutes**
- Paywall access issues
- Citation chasing
- Source verification difficulty

**Revised Total: 3.5-5 hours** (more realistic)

**Note:** If taking >5 hours, move to Plan B (enhancement strategy)

---

## Strengths Preserved

**✅ Keep from Original Plan:**
- Comprehensive source taxonomy (good)
- Output specifications (detailed and useful)
- Verification protocols (just tier them)
- Risk mitigation mindset (good)
- Research philosophy priorities (excellent)

---

## Critical Success Factors

**For V2.0 plan to succeed:**

1. **Mindset shift:** "Strong case + enhancement" > "perfect unicorn case"
2. **Source realism:** Academic/journalism > company postmortems
3. **Time realism:** 4-5 hours is acceptable, don't rush
4. **Quality threshold:** Citeable + explainable + paradoxical (core requirements)
5. **Backup readiness:** Plan B is acceptable, not failure

---

## Final Recommendations

**Execute V2.0 with these priorities:**

**P0 (Must Have):**
- 2024-2025 timeframe (flexible to Q3 2024)
- Citeable source (Tier 1-2)
- Quantified impact
- Explainable mechanism

**P1 (Optimize For):**
- Clear paradox (confidence increased)
- Named organization
- Multiple table dimensions
- Recent (2025 > 2024)

**P2 (Nice But Not Required):**
- Company postmortem
- Perfect 22+/25 score
- Single source (enhancement OK)

**Decision Rule:**
- 4/4 P0 + 2/4 P1 = Good enough for Plan A or Plan B
- Don't hold out for perfect case beyond 3 hours active search
- Better to have strong 2024 case with enhancement than weak 2025 case
