## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This comprehensive research identifies verified organizational examples of AI delegation success and failure from 2024-2025. The research reveals a stark "AI paradox": while 78% of organizations use AI in at least one business function [McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai), more than 80% report no significant bottom-line impact. The key differentiator is **workflow redesign** - organizations that fundamentally restructured processes around AI saw measurable EBIT impact, while those treating AI as automation for existing workflows failed to capture value.

**Key Finding:** Only 21% of organizations have redesigned workflows around AI, yet this single factor has the biggest effect on EBIT impact [McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai).

- Chatbot advised he could purchase tickets and claim bereavement discount within 90 days [CBC News, 2024](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/air-canada-chatbot-lawsuit-1.7116416)
- Moffatt bought $1,630.36 in tickets based on chatbot advice
- Air Canada later denied refund, citing different policy on website

**Legal Failure:**
- B.C. Civil Resolution Tribunal ruled in favor of customer [The Register, 2024](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/air_canada_chatbot_fine/)
- Air Canada attempted bizarre defense: chatbot was "separate legal entity responsible for its own actions"
- Tribunal rejected this argument decisively

**The Ruling:**
- Tribunal: "There is no reason why Mr. Moffatt should know that one section of Air Canada's webpage is accurate, and another is not"
- Air Canada "did not take reasonable care to ensure its chatbot was accurate"
- Ordered to pay $812 compensation [American Bar Association, 2024](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/resources/business-law-today/2024-february/bc-tribunal-confirms-companies-remain-liable-information-provided-ai-chatbot/)

#### Broader Impact

- **First case of its kind** in Canadian Legal Information Institute database

## PART 3: SUCCESS PATTERNS AND DIFFERENTIATORS

### Pattern 1: Workflow Redesign vs. Task Automation

**Key Insight:** The #1 differentiator between success and failure is workflow redesign, not AI sophistication.

**Evidence:**
- Workflow redesign has **biggest effect on EBIT impact** [McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- Only **21% of organizations** have fundamentally redesigned workflows
- 80%+ report no EBIT impact despite AI usage

**Success Pattern:**
- **Lumen:** Redesigned entire sales preparation process (4 hours → 15 minutes)
- **ATB Financial:** Restructured marketing workflow (saved 2 weeks per project)
- **MAIRE:** Created new workflows with "Human in the Loop" portal

**Failure Pattern:**
- **McDonald's:** Tried to automate existing drive-thru process without redesign
- **Most enterprises:** Treated AI as drop-in replacement for existing tasks
- Result: No bottom-line impact despite high AI usage

**Practical Implication:**
Don't ask "What tasks can AI do?" Ask "How should we restructure workflows to leverage AI?"

---

### Pattern 2: Task Selection Framework

**Key Insight:** Successful organizations carefully select which tasks to delegate based on identity, accountability, and risk.

**Evidence from Microsoft Product Manager Study:**
- 885 PMs surveyed, 62% use AI daily [arXiv, 2024](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.02504)
- Top delegated tasks: formatting (73%), summarizing (52%), email writing (33%)
- Avoided delegating: core identity tasks, high-accountability work
- Key principle: **"Accountability must not be delegated to non-human actors"**

**Success Pattern - Task Characteristics:**
1. **High-volume, repetitive** (Stream: 80% of routine customer questions)
2. **Low-risk, low-accountability** (ATB: drafting, summarizing)
3. **Time-consuming but not strategic** (MAIRE: translations, first drafts)
4. **Clearly bounded scope** (Lumen: pre-sales research only)

**Failure Pattern - Task Characteristics:**
1. **High-stakes, customer-facing** (McDonald's: direct customer orders)
2. **Legally binding information** (Air Canada: policy advice)
3. **Professional liability** (Legal AI: case citations)
4. **Complex judgment required** (Healthcare: medical decisions)

**Practical Framework:**
```
Delegate to AI:
- High volume + Low risk + Low identity + Repetitive
- Administrative + Internal + Informational

Do NOT delegate to AI (without oversight):
- Customer-facing + High risk + Core identity + Complex
- Legally binding + Professional liability + Strategic decisions
```

**Air Canada:**
- No policy verification system
- Chatbot contradicted official policies
- No mechanism for customers to verify information

**Legal AI:**
- Attorneys didn't verify citations
- No mandatory fact-checking workflow
- Assumed AI accuracy without validation

**Practical Implication:**
Every AI delegation must have explicit human oversight protocol matched to task risk level.

---

### Pattern 4: Pilot-Test-Scale Methodology

**Key Insight:** Successful organizations validated AI with pilots before scaling; failures skipped validation.

**Success Pattern - Phased Deployment:**

**ATB Financial:**
1. Pilot with hundreds of employees
2. Measured time savings (2 hours/week)
3. Validated security and compliance
4. Scaled to 5,000+ employees

**Lumen:**
1. Engaged "champions" as early adopters

- No validation against actual case law
- Professional consequences

**Practical Methodology:**
```
Phase 1: Pilot (small scale, high measurement)
  - Define success metrics upfront
  - Test with real users and real conditions
  - Measure outcomes rigorously
  - Identify failure modes

Phase 2: Validate (medium scale, continue measurement)
  - Confirm pilot results replicate
  - Refine based on learnings
  - Establish oversight protocols

Phase 3: Scale (broad deployment)
  - Roll out only after validation
  - Maintain measurement
  - Continuous improvement
```

- Example: NIST AI Risk Management Framework adoption

**Immature Organizations:**
- Treat AI as technology deployment, not organizational transformation
- Skip investment in upskilling
- Lack governance frameworks
- No systematic approach to risk management

**Practical Implication:**
AI maturity requires organizational capabilities, not just AI technology adoption.

---

### Pattern 6: Measurement and Transparency

**Key Insight:** Successful organizations measure concrete outcomes; failing organizations rely on anecdotes.

**Success Pattern - Specific Metrics:**

**Quantitative Measurement:**
- Lumen: 94% time reduction, $50M annual savings
- ATB Financial: 2 hours/week savings, 40% daily usage
- MAIRE: 800 hours/month (measured via Viva Insights)
- Stream: 80% automation rate
- Stacks: 10-15% of code AI-generated

- 49% unable to demonstrate value [Gartner, 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-05-07-gartner-survey-finds-generative-ai-is-now-the-most-frequently-deployed-ai-solution-in-organizations)
- Anecdotal "productivity" without measurement

**Practical Implication:**
Define concrete success metrics before deployment. Measure continuously. Report transparently.

---

### Pattern 7: Cultural and Leadership Factors

**Key Insight:** CEO oversight and organizational culture correlate strongly with AI success.

**Evidence:**
- CEO oversight has **most impact on EBIT** at larger companies [McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- Larger companies 2x more likely to have defined AI roadmaps
- Leadership gap identified as biggest barrier [McKinsey, 2024](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024)

**Success Pattern - Leadership Practices:**

**Champion Networks:**
- Lumen: Key people as champions driving adoption
- MAIRE: Copilot champions documenting use cases
- Distributed leadership, not just top-down

**Change Management:**
- ATB Financial: Education on AI capabilities
- McKnight Foundation: Mission alignment emphasized
- Microsoft PMs: "Leading by example" for managers

- McDonald's: Unclear who was accountable for accuracy
- Legal AI: No professional oversight protocols

**Missing Strategy:**
- 48% lack clear AI strategy [Harvard Business Review, 2024]
- 80% deploy AI but see no EBIT impact
- Experimentation without strategic direction

**Practical Implication:**
AI delegation succeeds when:
- CEO/leadership actively oversees (especially large orgs)
- Champion networks drive adoption
- Change management accompanies technology
- Clear strategy guides deployment

---

## PART 4: CROSS-CUTTING INSIGHTS

### Insight 1: The AI Paradox

**The Data:**
- 78% use AI in at least one function [McKinsey, 2025](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai)
- 80%+ report no significant bottom-line impact
- 95% of pilots fail to raise revenue [MIT NANDA, 2025]
- Only 1% call themselves "AI-mature"

**Why This Paradox Exists:**
1. **Automation ≠ Transformation:** Most organizations automate existing tasks rather than redesigning workflows
2. **Pilot Trap:** Experimenting without scaling successful pilots
3. **Missing Capabilities:** Lack the four foundational capabilities of AI-mature orgs
4. **Leadership Gap:** Insufficient CEO/leadership oversight

**Resolution:**
Success requires organizational transformation, not technology adoption.

---

### Insight 2: Risk Assessment Frameworks

**Emerging Framework from Success Cases:**

**Tier 1 - High Risk (Mandatory Oversight):**
- Customer-facing interactions
- Legally binding information
- Professional liability contexts
- Financial/medical decisions
- Strategic business decisions

**Tier 2 - Medium Risk (Human Review):**
- Internal customer service
- Policy information
- Code generation
- Data analysis/recommendations
- Content drafting

**Tier 3 - Low Risk (Monitoring):**
- Formatting and summarization
- Email drafting (internal)
- Translation (non-legal)
- Meeting scheduling
- Data organization

**Regulatory Context:**
- EU AI Act (August 2024): Risk-based classifications [EU, 2024](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L_202401689)
- NIST AI Risk Management Framework (July 2024) [NIST, 2024](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework)
- US State Department: AI and Human Rights profile [State Dept, 2024](https://2021-2025.state.gov/risk-management-profile-for-ai-and-human-rights/)

**Practical Application:**
Match oversight intensity to risk tier. High-risk tasks require mandatory human verification.

---

### Insight 3: The Data Quality Prerequisite

**The Evidence:**
- 77% rate organizational data as average/poor/very poor [AIIM, 2024](https://info.aiim.org/aiim-blog/ai-automation-trends-2024-insights-2025-outlook)
- RAG implementations fail with disorganized data (SharePoint chaos)
- Data quality identified as top obstacle

**Success Pattern:**

- Stacks: Structured accounting data for AI processing

**Failure Pattern:**
- Enterprise RAG failures with poor SharePoint data
- Hallucinations increase with poor data quality
- AI amplifies existing data problems

**Practical Implication:**
Fix data quality before AI deployment. AI won't solve data problems; it will amplify them.

---

### Insight 4: Security as Enabler, Not Barrier

**Counterintuitive Finding:**
Security requirements, properly implemented, enable AI adoption rather than blocking it.

**Evidence:**

**ATB Financial:**
- Enterprise-grade security was adoption enabler
- Allowed safe experimentation
- Compliance with banking regulations maintained

**McKnight Foundation:**
- Replaced unsecured AI tools with secure Copilot
- Enhanced cybersecurity while increasing AI use
- Security consolidation as benefit

**Failure Pattern:**
- Lack of secure platforms drives shadow AI usage
- Shadow AI creates compliance and security risks

- Reasoning models: 33-48% error rates [Techopedia, 2025](https://www.techopedia.com/ai-hallucinations-rise)
- Domain-specific tools: 17-34% hallucination rates
- OpenAI admits hallucinations "mathematically inevitable" [Computerworld, 2025]

**Success Pattern - Managing Hallucinations:**
- Zalando: Recognized risk, implemented strict prompting + human curation
- ATB Financial: Focused on low-stakes tasks (drafting, summarizing)
- Stream: Chose factual, repetitive queries (pay dates, balances)
- Microsoft PMs: Critical evaluation of all outputs

**Failure Pattern - Ignoring Hallucinations:**
- Legal attorneys assumed accuracy without verification
- Air Canada provided policy information without checks
- Healthcare transcription without validation

**Practical Implication:**
Assume all AI output may contain hallucinations. Design verification workflows accordingly.

---

### Insight 6: The Organizational Transformation Requirement

**Key Finding:**
AI delegation is organizational transformation, not IT deployment.

**What Must Change:**

**1. Workflows:**
- Redesign around AI capabilities (not retrofit AI into existing workflows)
- 21% have done this; they see EBIT impact

**2. Skills:**
- Upskilling for AI collaboration
- Critical evaluation capabilities
- Understanding AI limitations

**3. Culture:**
- Experimentation mindset
- Learning from failures
- Sharing successful practices (MAIRE's portal, Lumen's champions)

**4. Governance:**
- Risk management frameworks
- Oversight protocols
- Accountability structures

**5. Leadership:**
- CEO oversight (especially large orgs)
- Strategic clarity
- Change management

**Failure Pattern:**
Treating AI as "plug-and-play" technology without organizational change.

**Practical Implication:**
Budget for organizational change management, not just AI technology costs.

---

## PART 5: PRACTITIONER RECOMMENDATIONS

### Recommendation 1: Apply the Task Selection Framework

**Before delegating any task to AI, assess:**

1. **Risk Level:**
   - What happens if AI makes a mistake?
   - Customer-facing? Legally binding? Financial impact?

2. **Identity Factor:**
   - Is this task core to professional identity?
   - Does it require judgment/expertise specific to role?

3. **Accountability:**
   - Can I verify AI output?
   - Am I accountable for the result?
   - Do I have expertise to catch errors?

4. **Task Characteristics:**
   - High-volume and repetitive?
   - Clearly bounded scope?
   - Low-stakes if wrong?

**Decision Matrix:**
```
High Risk + Core Identity + Accountability = NO AI or MANDATORY OVERSIGHT
Low Risk + Non-Core + Repetitive = GOOD AI DELEGATION CANDIDATE
```

---

### Recommendation 2: Implement Tiered Oversight

**Match oversight intensity to risk level:**

**Tier 1 - Mandatory Human Verification:**
- Customer-facing interactions
- Legally binding statements
- Financial/medical decisions
- Professional liability contexts
- Strategic business decisions

**Oversight Protocol:**
- Human reviews every AI output before use
- Subject matter expert verification
- Documented review process

**Tier 2 - Human Review Required:**
- Internal customer service
- Policy information
- Code generation
- Data analysis
- Content drafting

**Oversight Protocol:**
- Spot-checking system
- Regular quality audits
- Easy escalation path

**Tier 3 - Monitoring:**
- Formatting/summarization
- Administrative tasks
- Low-stakes communication
- Data organization

**Oversight Protocol:**
- Usage monitoring
- Periodic quality checks
- User feedback collection

---

### Recommendation 3: Follow Pilot-Test-Scale Methodology

**Phase 1: Pilot (4-8 weeks)**
- **Scale:** Small team (10-50 users)
- **Metrics:** Define specific success criteria upfront
- **Testing:** Real conditions, diverse users, realistic tasks
- **Learning:** Document what works, what fails, why

**Success Criteria Examples:**
- Lumen: 90%+ time reduction for sales research
- ATB: 2+ hours/week savings, 40%+ daily usage
- MAIRE: 500+ hours/month measurable savings

**Phase 2: Validate (8-12 weeks)**
- **Scale:** Medium deployment (50-500 users)
- **Metrics:** Confirm pilot results replicate
- **Testing:** Refine oversight protocols
- **Learning:** Establish best practices, training materials

**Phase 3: Scale (Ongoing)**
- **Scale:** Full deployment
- **Metrics:** Maintain continuous measurement
- **Governance:** Formalize oversight and quality processes
- **Learning:** Champion networks, knowledge sharing

**DO NOT:**
- Skip pilot testing (McDonald's mistake)
- Scale before validation (most enterprise failures)
- Deploy without defined metrics (80% seeing no impact)

---

### Recommendation 4: Redesign Workflows, Don't Automate

**Wrong Approach:**
"What existing tasks can AI automate?"

**Right Approach:**
"How should we restructure this workflow to leverage AI capabilities?"

**Example - Lumen Sales Process:**

**Old Workflow (4 hours):**
1. Manual research of customer history
2. Review previous interactions
3. Analyze customer needs
4. Prepare outreach materials
5. Schedule call/meeting

**Redesigned Workflow (15 minutes):**
1. AI synthesizes customer data and history
2. AI provides insights and recommendations
3. Human reviews AI summary (5 min)
4. Human adds strategic context (5 min)
5. Human personalizes outreach (5 min)
6. More time for actual customer interaction

**Key Difference:**
- Not just "AI does step 1"
- Entire process restructured around AI capabilities
- Human role elevated to strategic work

**Practical Exercise:**
1. Map current workflow step-by-step
2. Identify which steps are candidates for AI (repetitive, low-stakes)
3. Redesign entire workflow assuming AI handles those steps
4. Elevate human role to oversight + strategic work

---

### Recommendation 5: Build AI Maturity Capabilities

**Based on Gartner's AI-mature organization characteristics:**

**Capability 1: Scalable AI Operating Model**
- Create centralized AI governance board
- Establish AI usage guidelines

- Automation rate (Stream: 80% of routine inquiries)
- Hours saved per month (MAIRE: 800 hours/month)
- Adoption rate (ATB: 40% daily usage in pilot)
- Code contribution (Stacks: 10-15% AI-generated)

**Bad Metrics (Vague, Unmeasurable):**
- "Increased productivity"
- "Improved efficiency"
- "Enhanced experience"
- "Better outcomes"

**Measurement Infrastructure:**
- Use platform analytics (Viva Insights, usage dashboards)
- Track before/after comparisons
- Survey users quantitatively
- Monitor quality metrics continuously

**Transparency:**
- Report metrics honestly (including failures)
- Share learnings across organization
- Update based on data

---

### Recommendation 7: Prepare for Hallucinations

**Assume all AI output may contain errors:**

**Verification Workflows:**

**High-Stakes Tasks:**
- Mandatory fact-checking of all AI output
- Subject matter expert review
- Multiple source verification
- Documented review process

**Example:** Legal AI must verify every citation independently. No exceptions.

**Medium-Stakes Tasks:**
- Spot-checking system
- Regular quality audits
- User training on error detection

**Example:** Code review all AI-generated code before merging.

**Technical Strategies:**
- Implement strict prompting strategies (Zalando approach)
- Use constrained output formats when possible
- Request citations/sources with AI output
- Build verification into workflow, not optional

**Cultural Strategies:**
- Normalize finding AI errors (not stigmatized)
- Reward catching and reporting hallucinations
- Share error patterns across organization
- Continuous learning from mistakes

---

### Recommendation 8: Address Data Quality First

**Before large-scale AI deployment:**

**Assess Current Data:**
- Is data organized and findable?
- Is data accurate and up-to-date?
- Is data consistently formatted?
- Is sensitive data properly secured?

**If Data Quality Is Poor:**
1. **Don't deploy AI at scale** - It will amplify problems
2. **Start data quality initiative** first
3. **Pilot AI in domains with clean data**
4. **Use AI success as motivation** for data improvement

**Data Quality Enablers for AI:**
- Clean, organized knowledge bases (not SharePoint chaos)
- Consistent formatting and schemas
- Proper metadata and tagging
- Version control and audit trails
- Appropriate access controls

**Practical Priority:**
Fix data quality = unlocking AI value. Poor data = AI amplifies problems.

---

### Recommendation 9: Build Secure Infrastructure

**Don't allow shadow AI usage:**

**Provide Enterprise-Grade Platforms:**
- Secure, compliant AI tools (like ATB's Gemini, McKnight's Copilot)
- Clear acceptable use policies
- Training on secure usage
- Easy access to approved tools

**Benefits:**

- Enables governance and oversight
- Allows experimentation within guardrails
- Reduces compliance risk

**Address Regulatory Requirements:**
- Understand applicable regulations (EU AI Act, NIST, etc.)
- Implement required oversight for high-risk use cases
- Document AI usage and decision-making
- Prepare for audits and transparency requirements

**Practical Approach:**
Security as enabler, not blocker. Invest in secure platforms that enable safe experimentation.

---

### Recommendation 10: Cultivate Leadership and Culture

**CEO/Leadership Actions:**

**Strategic Clarity:**
- Define specific AI outcomes (not vague "adopt AI")
- Integrate AI strategy with business strategy
- Allocate resources for organizational change, not just technology

**Oversight:**
- Active monitoring of AI initiatives (especially large orgs)
- Regular review of metrics and outcomes
- Accountability for AI results

**Change Management:**
- Champion AI adoption visibly
- Address fears and resistance
- Celebrate successes and learn from failures

**Cultural Enablers:**

**Experimentation Mindset:**
- Make failure permissible for learning (MIT Sloan)
- Reward evidence-based iteration
- Fast experiments feeding long-term strategy

**Knowledge Sharing:**
- Create platforms for sharing AI practices (MAIRE portal)
- Champion networks (Lumen approach)
- Cross-functional collaboration

**Continuous Learning:**
- Ongoing training and upskilling
- Adaptation to evolving AI capabilities
- Critical thinking about AI limitations

**Practical Implementation:**
Build AI adoption into organizational culture, not just technology stack.

---

## CONCLUSION: THE AI DELEGATION FORMULA

**Based on analysis of 47+ sources and 10+ organizational case studies:**

### What Separates Success from Failure

**Successful AI Delegation:**
1. ✅ Workflow redesign (not task automation)
2. ✅ Careful task selection (risk-based framework)
3. ✅ Mandatory human oversight (matched to risk)
4. ✅ Pilot-test-scale methodology
5. ✅ AI maturity capabilities
6. ✅ Concrete metrics and measurement
7. ✅ Hallucination awareness and verification
8. ✅ Clean data infrastructure
9. ✅ Secure enterprise platforms
10. ✅ Leadership oversight and cultural support

**Failed AI Delegation:**
1. ❌ Automated existing workflows without redesign
2. ❌ Delegated high-risk tasks without assessment
3. ❌ Inadequate or missing human oversight
4. ❌ Skipped validation, scaled prematurely
5. ❌ Treated as IT project, not transformation
6. ❌ Vague metrics or no measurement
7. ❌ Assumed AI accuracy without verification
8. ❌ Poor data quality amplified by AI
9. ❌ Shadow AI or insufficient security
10. ❌ Leadership gap and cultural resistance

### The AI Paradox Resolution

**The Paradox:** 78% use AI, 80% see no EBIT impact

**The Resolution:**
- AI adoption ≠ AI value
- Technology deployment ≠ Organizational transformation
- Task automation ≠ Workflow redesign
- Experimentation ≠ Strategic implementation

**The Path Forward:**
Organizations that invest in organizational capabilities (not just AI technology) will capture AI value. The 21% that redesigned workflows see EBIT impact. The 9% that are AI-mature have the four foundational capabilities.

Success requires treating AI delegation as organizational transformation requiring workflow redesign, capability building, risk management, and cultural change - not as technology deployment requiring only budget and IT resources.
