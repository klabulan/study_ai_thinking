**Three Common Oversight Approaches**
1. Policies specify algorithms must have human oversight (ban on "fire and forget" systems)
2. Policies specify humans can exercise discretion when overriding AI (apply human judgment)
3. Policies require human oversight to be "meaningful" - more than rubber stamp, with thorough review of AI inputs/outputs for high-stakes decisions

**Evidence Supporting Practice:**
1. **Amazon Science (2024)**: Task decomposition enables 70-90% cost reduction
2. **TDAG Framework**: Dynamic decomposition enhances adaptability in real-world tasks
3. **Multiple industry frameworks**: Anthropic AI Fluency, DROID Framework, TDAG all emphasize structured decomposition

**Risk Assessment Evidence:**
1. **NIST AI RMF**: Comprehensive framework with seven characteristics for responsible AI
2. **MIT AI Risk Repository**: 1600+ categorized risks providing systematic assessment approach
3. **ISO 31000 principles**: Risk-based approach with stress testing as critical capability

**Contrasting Evidence (Ad-Hoc Failure):**
1. **RAND (2024)**: 80% of AI projects fail, primarily due to lack of clear planning
2. **S&P Global (2024)**: Businesses scrapping AI initiatives increased from 17% to 42% in one year
3. **Ponemon Institute (2024)**: Poor oversight costs 2.3x more than supervised systems

**Conclusion**: Strong evidence that systematic task decomposition and risk assessment significantly improve AI delegation outcomes vs ad-hoc approaches.

### Stage 2: Capability Mapping - VALIDATED ✓

**Evidence That Representative Testing Beats Benchmarks:**
1. **OpenAI GDPval (2024)**: Real-world task measurement across 44 occupations with expert evaluation
2. **Benchmark limitations research**: Data contamination, cultural bias, outdated benchmarks undermine validity
3. **SWE-bench analysis**: 38.3% underspecified, 61.1% flawed tests - benchmarks don't reflect real performance

**Evidence That Distribution Matters:**
1. **Statistical Volatility Index (2024)**: New metric weighing performance variance, prompt sensitivity, context stability, error consistency
2. **METR findings**: Performance varies from 100% (short tasks) to <10% (long tasks) - averages mask critical gaps
3. **New challenging benchmarks**: Humanity's Last Exam (8.80%), FrontierMath (2%), BigCodeBench (35.5% vs 97% human)

**Real-World Implementation:**
1. **OpenAI o1 pre-deployment**: US AISI and UK AISI joint evaluation before public release
2. **Cross-company evaluations**: Anthropic and OpenAI evaluating each other's models (2025)

3. **EU AI Act Article 14**: Legal framework requiring risk-commensurate oversight

**Real-World Implementation:**
1. **Financial services**: Intesa Sanpaolo's Democratic Data Lab with risk management oversight
2. **Healthcare**: Medical imaging with required radiology expertise for oversight
3. **Kyndryl Agentic AI Framework (2025)**: Enterprise framework keeping humans in loop

**Industry Leading Example:**
1. **Anthropic RSP**: AI Safety Levels (ASL) framework modeled after biosafety standards
2. **Comprehensive governance**: RSP Officer, Executive Risk Council, Board oversight, specialized teams
3. **First-year review**: Transparency about compliance gaps and continuous improvement

**Evidence That Matching Oversight to Risk Improves Outcomes:**
1. **Ponemon Institute (2024)**: Proper oversight reduces failure costs by 2.3x
2. **EU AI Act**: Risk-commensurate oversight requirement based on evidence
3. **Board governance trends**: 84% jump in AI-related disclosures (2023-2024) correlating with recognition of oversight importance

**Conclusion**: Strong evidence for taxonomy of oversight levels, successful real-world implementations, and measurable outcome improvements when oversight matches risk level.

## OVERALL FRAMEWORK VALIDATION: STRONGLY SUPPORTED

All three stages of the proposed delegation framework are validated by:
- **Peer-reviewed research** (RAND, METR, academic studies)
- **Industry frameworks** (Anthropic RSP, OpenAI evaluations, NIST AI RMF)
- **Regulatory requirements** (EU AI Act, US national security policies)
- **Measurable outcomes** (cost savings, failure rate reductions, performance improvements)
- **Real-world implementations** (Financial services, healthcare, major AI labs)

The framework represents current best practices for AI delegation as of 2024-2025, with strong empirical and practical support across all three stages.
