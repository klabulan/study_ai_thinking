## Sources and Key Findings

### 1. GPT-4o (May 2024) - True Multimodal Foundation

**Release:** OpenAI released GPT-4o ("o" for "omni") in May 2024 as the first truly integrated multimodal model [OpenAI, 2024](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Unified Processing:** Accepts any combination of text, audio, image, and video inputs and generates text, audio, and image outputs - all processed by the same neural network [OpenAI, 2024](https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/)
- **Real-time Response:** Can respond to audio inputs in as little as 232 milliseconds (average 320ms), matching human conversation speed [Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o)
- **Performance Boost:** Scored 88.7 on MMLU benchmark vs 86.5 for GPT-4; 50% cheaper in API while matching GPT-4 Turbo performance [TechTarget, 2024](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/GPT-4o-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know)
- **Massive Context:** 128K token context window with knowledge through October 2023 [IBM, 2024](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/gpt-4o)
- **Global Scale:** Supports over 50 languages covering 97% of global speakers [Wikipedia, 2024](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o)

**Delegation Impact:** The unified neural architecture means organizations can now delegate complex tasks involving multiple modalities (analyzing documents with images, processing voice commands, generating visual content) to a single AI system instead of maintaining separate specialized tools.

## Summary: Why Capabilities Make Delegation Urgent NOW

**The Convergence:**
1. **Multimodal Integration** (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0) - Can handle diverse task types
2. **Autonomous Operation** (Claude computer use) - Can control systems independently
3. **Advanced Reasoning** (o1/o3) - Can solve complex problems
4. **Production-Ready Tools** (Broad ecosystem) - Infrastructure exists at scale

**The Tipping Point:**
These capabilities crossed from "impressive demos" to "production-ready" in 2024. Organizations now face a strategic imperative: develop delegation frameworks before competitors do, or risk being left behind in the agentic era.
