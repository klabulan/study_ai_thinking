# Task 1 Research Plan: Opening Hook Case Study (REVISED)

## Research Objective

Find ONE dramatic, well-documented AI delegation failure from 2024-2025 that demonstrates the paradox: "followed best practices but failed because of delegation framework mismatch"

**Core Paradox to Illustrate:**
- Organization followed human delegation best practices (HITL, phased rollout, training)
- Confidence metrics IMPROVED
- Outcome was catastrophic failure
- Treating AI like a junior employee made things worse

---

## CRITICAL DECISIONS: Timeline & Scope

### Realistic Timeline Assessment

**Original estimate:** 2-3 hours
**Realistic assessment:** 5-6 hours

**Decision:** EXTENDED TIMELINE (5-6 hours justified)

**Rationale:**
- Opening hook is THE most critical element of entire post
- Perfect case worth extra investment (sets up all subsequent content)
- Quality threshold is non-negotiable (must be verified, dramatic, recent)
- Finding 2024-2025 cases with full documentation takes time
- Multiple verification rounds needed

**Time allocation:**
- Phase A (Wide Search): 90-120 minutes (30-min priority blocks)
- Phase B (Scoring & Filtering): 45-60 minutes
- Phase C (Deep Verification): 90-120 minutes
- Phase D (Final Selection): 30 minutes
- **Total: 5-6 hours**

---

## Search Strategy with Priority Time Blocks

### Phase A: Primary Source Hunting (90-120 minutes total)

**30-MINUTE PRIORITY BLOCKS (Execute in order):**

#### Block 1: Investigative Tech Journalism (30 min) - HIGHEST YIELD
**Why first:** Recent, accessible, verified sources with narrative detail

**Target sources:**
- Wired, Ars Technica, IEEE Spectrum, MIT Technology Review
- The Verge, Protocol (RIP), Platformer
- 404 Media (tech investigation focus)

**Search queries:**
- "AI failure 2024" site:wired.com
- "AI incident 2025" site:arstechnica.com
- "AI deployment disaster" site:spectrum.ieee.org
- "AI system failure" site:technologyreview.com

**2-minute verification during search:**
- [ ] Is organization/system specific?
- [ ] Are metrics quantified?
- [ ] Is source verifiable (named journalists, publication date)?
- [ ] Does it show paradox elements?

**Document ONLY cases passing verification. Skip vague incidents.**

#### Block 2: Company Engineering Blogs & Postmortems (30 min)
**Why second:** First-party documentation, high detail

**Target sources:**
- Major tech company engineering blogs (Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Stripe)
- Postmortem aggregators (postmortems.app, Hacker News "Ask HN: Postmortems")
- GitHub incident reports

**Search queries:**
- "AI incident postmortem 2024"
- "lessons learned AI deployment"
- site:engineering.fb.com "AI failure"
- site:github.blog "incident"

**2-minute verification:**
- [ ] Specific system and task identified?
- [ ] Timeline and metrics provided?
- [ ] "Best practices" element documented?
- [ ] Case is public (not NDA-protected)?

#### Block 3: Academic Case Studies (30 min)
**Why third:** Rigorous documentation, may be older or less dramatic

**Target sources:**
- CHI 2024, CHI 2025 proceedings (human-computer interaction)
- CSCW 2024 (computer-supported cooperative work)
- FAccT 2024, FAccT 2025 (fairness, accountability, transparency)

**Search queries:**
- "AI deployment case study" site:dl.acm.org
- "human-AI interaction failure" (2024-2025 filter)
- "AI trust calibration" conference:CHI

**2-minute verification:**
- [ ] Real organizational deployment (not lab study)?
- [ ] Sufficient narrative detail for retelling?
- [ ] Paradox elements present?

#### Block 4: Industry Reports with Named Cases (30 min) - IF TIME PERMITS
**Why fourth:** Often high-level, may lack specificity

**Target sources:**
- Gartner, McKinsey, Stanford AI Index 2024-2025
- MIT Sloan Management Review
- Harvard Business Review (AI section)

**Search focus:**
- Named case studies (not aggregate statistics)
- Reports with "lessons learned" sections
- Documented failures with details

**Paywall mitigation strategy:**
- Check institutional access (university library proxies)
- Look for "executive summary" free versions
- Search for author presentations/talks discussing cases
- Request documents via research networks if critical

---

### Phase B: Scoring & Filtering (45-60 minutes)

**Scoring Rubric (5 dimensions, 1-5 each):**

#### 1. Dramatic Impact (1=minor, 5=catastrophic)
- **5 points:** Major financial loss (>$1M), safety incident, widespread user impact
- **4 points:** Significant damage ($100K-$1M), notable reputation harm
- **3 points:** Measurable negative outcome, contained impact
- **2 points:** Minor damage, mostly internal
- **1 point:** Negligible impact

#### 2. Paradox Clarity (1=weak, 5=perfect)
- **5 points:** EXPLICIT evidence confidence increased + best practices documented + failure was surprise
- **4 points:** Strong evidence of 2/3 paradox elements
- **3 points:** Paradox inferable but not explicit
- **2 points:** Weak paradox elements
- **1 point:** No clear paradox

**CRITICAL:** Cases with <3/5 paradox clarity are NOT usable (even if dramatic)

#### 3. Comparison Table Setup (1=weak, 5=perfect)
- **5 points:** Naturally exposes 3+ table dimensions with concrete examples
- **4 points:** Clearly sets up 2 dimensions
- **3 points:** Sets up 1 dimension well
- **2 points:** Tangentially related to table
- **1 point:** Doesn't support table need

#### 4. Source Quality (1=poor, 5=excellent)
- **5 points:** Tier 1 - Peer-reviewed case study with full verification
- **4 points:** Tier 2 - Industry report with detailed sourcing OR investigative journalism with named sources
- **3 points:** Tier 3 - Company postmortem with specifics OR verified anonymous academic case
- **2 points:** Secondary reporting with some verification
- **1 point:** Unverifiable or weak sourcing

**LOWER than 3 = disqualify**

#### 5. Retellability (1=vague, 5=vivid)
- **5 points:** Can draft compelling 200-word narrative immediately with specific details
- **4 points:** Good narrative bones, needs minor detail enhancement
- **3 points:** Core story clear but needs development
- **2 points:** Vague, hard to visualize
- **1 point:** Abstract or incomprehensible

**Minimum total score: 18/25 to be considered**
**Target score: 22+/25 for final selection**
**Cases scoring 16-17 with exceptional paradox clarity (5/5): Consider if nothing better found**

### Tiebreaker Weights (if multiple cases score similarly)

**Priority order:**
1. **Source quality** (Tier 1 > Tier 2 > Tier 3) - Most important
2. **Paradox clarity** (5/5 > 4/5) - Critical for post thesis
3. **Recency** (2025 > 2024) - Establishes urgency
4. **Dramatic impact** (higher score preferred) - Engagement

**Exceptions to recency priority:**
- Exceptionally well-documented 2024 case (source quality 5/5) beats poorly-documented 2025 case (source quality 3/5)
- If 2024 case has perfect paradox clarity (5/5) and 2025 case is weak (3/5), prefer 2024

---

## Verification Standards

### "Verified Anonymous" Case Criteria

**A case can be anonymous IF:**
- Source is Tier 1-2 quality (peer-reviewed journal OR respected institution)
- Organization type is specific ("Fortune 500 healthcare company" not "a company")
- AI system is specific (GPT-4, Claude 3, custom model architecture)
- Task/workflow is detailed enough to visualize
- Metrics are quantified with timeframes
- Failure mechanism is explained technically

**Example of ACCEPTABLE anonymous case:**
"Large US healthcare system (5 hospitals, 2000 beds) deployed GPT-4 for medical documentation summarization in Q1 2024. After 3-month pilot with 50 doctors showing 40% time savings, scaled to 500 doctors. Within 6 weeks, 12 critical medication errors traced to AI-generated summaries omitting allergy warnings. Investigation found: oversight decreased as confidence increased, doctors skimmed AI summaries instead of reading source notes."

**Example of UNACCEPTABLE anonymous case:**
"A company used AI for customer service and had problems because they trusted it too much."

### "Confidence Increased" Evidence Scale

**Evidence quality levels:**

**STRONG evidence (prefer):**
- Documented metrics showing trust/reliance increased over time
- Survey data or usage logs showing declining human oversight
- Explicit quotes from participants: "We started checking less"
- A/B comparison: supervised phase vs autonomous phase error rates

**MEDIUM evidence (acceptable):**
- Narrative description of increasing trust over rollout
- Comparison of early vs late deployment behavior
- Evidence of process relaxation over time
- Testimony that "things seemed to be going well"

**WEAK evidence (use only if no better options):**
- Inference that confidence must have increased
- Assumption based on deployment structure
- No direct evidence of trust trajectory

**Minimum bar:** Medium evidence required. Weak evidence insufficient.

### Quick Verification Filter (During Search)

**2-MINUTE VERIFICATION CHECKLIST (apply during Block 1-4):**

For each candidate:
- [ ] **Specificity:** Named org OR detailed anonymous case?
- [ ] **Metrics:** Quantified impact documented?
- [ ] **Source:** Tier 1-3 source with URL?
- [ ] **Timeline:** 2024-2025?
- [ ] **Paradox signal:** Any mention of "unexpected failure" or "despite precautions"?

**If 3+ boxes unchecked: SKIP. Don't document.**
**If 3+ boxes checked: Document for scoring phase.**

This filter prevents wasting time on unverifiable cases.

---

## Discovery Zones (Unexpected Findings)

**Look specifically for:**

1. **"More AI Oversight" Paradox**
   - Case where adding MORE human supervision made outcomes WORSE
   - Example: Supervision created false confidence
   - Example: Review process missed AI-specific failure modes

2. **"Treated AI Like Human" Failure**
   - Case where traditional management practices directly caused failure
   - Example: Gradual autonomy increase created capability cliff
   - Example: Performance reviews that didn't detect AI limitations

3. **Unexpected Table Dimension**
   - Failure that exposes dimension NOT in current comparison table
   - Would force addition of 6th dimension
   - Novel insight into AI vs human delegation difference

4. **2025 Capability Shift**
   - Failure related to NEW AI capabilities (2024-2025 models)
   - Something that wouldn't have happened with 2023 models
   - Establishes urgency (this is new problem)

---

## Nightmare Scenario Decision Rules

### Scenario 1: 3-hour search yields only weak cases (all scoring <18/25)

**Decision rule:**
- EXTEND search by 2 hours (to 5 hours total)
- Switch to Block 4 sources (industry reports, academic databases)
- Lower minimum score to 16/25 IF paradox clarity is 5/5 or source quality is 5/5
- Consider expanding timeframe to 2023 (but must document why 2025 cases unavailable)

**Do NOT:**
- Use unverified cases
- Fabricate or embellish
- Use composite without clear disclosure

### Scenario 2: 5-hour search yields only borderline cases (scoring 18-20/25)

**Decision rule:**
- Select best available case (highest score)
- EXPLICITLY acknowledge limitations in usage guidance
- Recommend additional verification before publication
- Document what ideal case would include (for future research)

**Acceptable compromise:**
- Dramatic impact: 4/5 (prefer 5/5 but 4/5 acceptable)
- Paradox clarity: Must be 4/5 minimum (non-negotiable)
- Source quality: Must be 4/5 minimum (Tier 1-2 only)

### Scenario 3: Multiple excellent cases found (3+ scoring 22+/25)

**Decision rule:**
- Select using tiebreaker weights
- Document alternatives as backups in detailed research file
- Note if different cases expose different table dimensions
- Consider mentioning multiple cases briefly in post (if space permits)

### Scenario 4: Perfect case found but behind paywall

**Decision rule:**
- PURSUE access (mitigation strategy above)
- If access impossible within time budget:
  - Use case IF sufficient detail available in abstract/preview/presentation
  - Cite properly with access limitation noted
  - OR select second-best case with full access
  - OR allocate 1 additional hour to acquire access (library, author request)

### Scenario 5: Best case is very recent (Jan-Feb 2025) with limited verification

**Decision rule:**
- Require multiple source verification (2+ independent sources)
- Look for official company acknowledgment OR journalistic verification
- Acceptable IF:
  - Source quality is Tier 1-2
  - Facts are specific enough to verify
  - No contradictory reporting found
- Document recency limitation in usage guidance

---

## Phase C: Deep Verification (90-120 minutes)

### Verification Process for Top 3 Candidates

**For each of top 3 scored cases:**

#### Step 1: Source Verification (15-20 min per case)
- [ ] Is source Tier 1-3 in quality hierarchy?
- [ ] Can original source be cited with working URL?
- [ ] Are authors credible (check byline, institutional affiliation)?
- [ ] Is publication reputable (check editorial standards)?
- [ ] Cross-check: Are there secondary sources confirming details?

#### Step 2: Fact Verification (15-20 min per case)
- [ ] Are specific claims verifiable (dates, companies, systems)?
- [ ] Do metrics have clear provenance (source data documented)?
- [ ] Can key facts be cross-referenced with other sources?
- [ ] Are technical details accurate (AI system capabilities match reality)?
- [ ] Is timeline plausible (deployment scale realistic for timeframe)?

#### Step 3: Narrative Verification (10-15 min per case)
- [ ] Is the "best practices" claim supported by specific evidence?
- [ ] Is the "confidence increased" claim documented (not just inferred)?
- [ ] Is the failure mechanism clear enough to explain technically?
- [ ] Are cause-effect relationships supported (or speculative)?
- [ ] Does paradox logic hold up (following rules actually made it worse)?

#### Step 4: Ethical Verification (5-10 min per case)
- [ ] Is case publicly documented (not exposing confidential info)?
- [ ] If organization is named, is this from public postmortem/news?
- [ ] If anonymous, is it from legitimate academic/industry source?
- [ ] Are individuals anonymized appropriately (no doxxing risk)?
- [ ] Would using this case harm anyone unfairly?

#### Step 5: Retellability Test (10-15 min per case)
- Draft 200-word opening hook narrative
- Test: Does it create cognitive dissonance?
- Test: Can reader visualize the scenario?
- Test: Does it naturally motivate comparison table need?
- Test: Is it memorable?

**Time per case: 45-60 minutes**
**Total for top 3: 90-120 minutes**

---

## Phase D: Final Selection (30 minutes)

### Selection Process

**Step 1: Compare top 3 verified cases**
- Review scores (all dimensions)
- Compare retellability drafts
- Apply tiebreaker weights
- Check alignment with post needs

**Step 2: Select THE ONE case**
- Highest total score (with tiebreakers applied)
- Must score 20+/25 after verification
- Must pass all 4 verification steps
- Must have retellability draft that works

**Step 3: Document selection rationale**
- Why this case over alternatives?
- What dimensions does it expose?
- What limitations should be acknowledged?
- What is backup case?

**Step 4: Prepare output files**
- Primary output: Research summary with selected case
- Secondary output: Detailed research with all candidates

---

## Research Philosophy (Unchanged)

**Prioritize:**
- ✅ Quality over speed (5-6 hours justified for perfect case)
- ✅ Verification over volume (one verified case > ten unverified)
- ✅ Specificity over generality (concrete details > abstract patterns)
- ✅ Recent over comprehensive (2025 case > exhaustive 2020-2025 survey)

**Remember:**
- This case opens the entire post
- It must create cognitive dissonance
- It must feel real and immediate
- It must naturally lead to "we need a framework"

**The opening hook is the most important 200 words of the entire 4,500-word post.**

**Finding the perfect case is worth the 5-6 hour investment.**
