## 1. Neural Architecture: Similarities and Fundamental Differences

### 1.1 Structural Comparisons

**Source 1:** Fast Data Science Research on Neural Networks and Brain Similarity
[How similar are Neural Networks to our Brains?](https://fastdatascience.com/ai-in-research/how-similar-are-neural-networks-to-our-brains/)

While neural networks were biologically inspired, there are many fundamental differences between deep neural networks and the human brain. Like biological neurons, artificial neural networks learn by adjusting the strengths of connections between neurons, but the similarity ends there.

**Source 2:** University of Oxford Study on Brain Learning Mechanisms (January 2024)
[Study shows that the way the brain learns is different from AI systems](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-01-03-study-shows-way-brain-learns-different-way-artificial-intelligence-systems-learn)

In artificial neural networks, an external algorithm tries to modify synaptic connections to reduce error. However, researchers propose that the human brain first settles the activity of neurons into an optimal balanced configuration before adjusting synaptic connections. This represents a fundamentally different learning mechanism.

**Source 3:** MIT News - Neural Network and Brain Function Comparison (2022)
[Study urges caution when comparing neural networks to the brain](https://news.mit.edu/2022/neural-networks-brain-function-1102)

The workhorse of AI systems is the 'back-propagation algorithm' (co-invented by 2024 Nobel Prize winner Geoffrey Hinton), which is generally acknowledged to be implausible as a biological learning mechanism.

**Source 4:** Quanta Magazine - AI vs Brain Architecture (2024)
[AI Is Nothing Like a Brain, and That's OK](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-is-nothing-like-a-brain-and-thats-ok-20250430/)

AI systems such as ChatGPT do not have any temporal dynamics - after a conversation is over, a ChatGPT system simply stops; there is no ongoing activity, as there always is for a brain. In other words, these systems have no internal dynamics.

**Source 5:** PMC - Evaluation of Hierarchical Correspondence Between Human Brain and ANNs
[Evaluation of the Hierarchical Correspondence between the Human Brain and Artificial Neural Networks](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10604784/)

Neurons vastly outnumber their ANN analogs (nodes), and the key algorithm responsible for most modern ANN training (backpropagation) is likely absent from the brain. The human brain functions using 100 billion neurons and has about 100 trillion synapses, which are the junctions between two neurons.

### 1.2 Learning and Memory Mechanisms

**Source 6:** PMC - Neural Reshaping and Plasticity (2024)
[Neural reshaping: the plasticity of human brain and artificial intelligence in the learning process](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11751442/)

A key issue is catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, where AI models struggle to retain previously learned information when new data is introduced. Unlike the brain, which employs mechanisms like synaptic plasticity to consolidate important memories and prune irrelevant ones, AI systems overwrite previously learned information when encountering new information.

**Source 7:** Royal Society of Biologists - AI versus the Human Brain
[AI versus the human brain](https://www.rsb.org.uk/biologist-features/ai-versus-the-brain)

AI has "no way to reason" like a human brain does, according to researcher Srikanth Ramaswamy. AI systems have matched, and even surpassed, the human brain in tasks like object recognition and language translation, but lack the reasoning capabilities inherent to biological brains.

**Source 8:** MIT Researcher Ev Fedorenko Study (2024)
Referenced in: Fast Data Science article

A 2024 preprint study found that artificial neural networks and the human brain can process sentences in a similar way, exhibiting what's called "universality of representation". This suggests some meaningful correspondence in language processing, though the mechanisms differ fundamentally.

## 2. Reasoning and Cognitive Processing

### 2.1 Reasoning Capabilities and Limitations

**Source 9:** Frontiers in AI - Hybrid Human-LLM Reasoning (2024)
[Fostering effective hybrid human-LLM reasoning and decision making](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2024.1464690/full)

LLM and human reasoning are not the same, as they respond differently to strategic cues and are ruled by different biases.

**Source 10:** Strategy Science - Theory, AI, Human Cognition, and Causal Reasoning (2024)
[Theory Is All You Need: AI, Human Cognition, and Causal Reasoning](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/stsc.2024.0189)

AI uses a probability-based approach to knowledge and is largely backward looking and imitative, whereas human cognition is forward-looking and capable of generating genuine novelty. AI-based models of cognition largely focus on patterns based on past associations and correlations; prediction is based on past data.

**Source 11:** Springer Nature Research Communities - Do LLMs Reason Like Humans?
[Do Large Language Models reason like us?](https://communities.springernature.com/posts/do-large-language-models-reason-the-way-we-do)

Most of the included models presented reasoning errors akin to those frequently ascribed to error-prone, heuristic-based human reasoning. However, humans and models respond differently to prompting strategies, highlighting differences in cognitive processing.

**Source 12:** MIT News - LLM Reasoning Skills Assessment (July 2024)
[Reasoning skills of large language models are often overestimated](https://news.mit.edu/2024/reasoning-skills-large-language-models-often-overestimated-0711)

When an LLM encounters a reasoning task, it merely reproduces the linguistic answers about reasoning it has encountered in the training data rather than engaging in any form of actual, on-the-fly reasoning. If the wording of a reasoning task is changed only slightly, LLM performance declines significantly below human performance, and the mistakes are glaringly obvious to humans.

**Source 13:** Kili Technology - The Ultimate Guide to LLM Reasoning (2025)
[The Ultimate Guide to LLM Reasoning (2025)](https://kili-technology.com/large-language-models-llms/llm-reasoning-guide)

"We've uncovered a fascinating aspect of large language models: they excel in familiar scenarios, almost like a well-worn path, but struggle when the terrain gets unfamiliar."

**Source 14:** ScienceDirect - Challenging LLMs with Prefrontal Functioning (2024)
[Challenging large language models' "intelligence" with human tools](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844024149420)

GPT-3.5 showed inhomogeneous results on prefrontal tests, with some tests well above average, others in the lower range, and others frankly impaired. Specifically, poor planning abilities and difficulty in recognizing semantic absurdities and understanding others' intentions and mental states were identified.

**Source 15:** Nature Communications Psychology - Studying and Improving Reasoning in Humans and Machines
[Studying and improving reasoning in humans and machines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44271-024-00091-8)

At least at the present time, we are not ready to substitute human participants with LLMs to better understand human psychology, as some authors have suggested recently, or model our own cognition on their structure.

### 2.2 Causal Reasoning vs Pattern Recognition

**Source 16:** Neil Sahota - Causal AI and Correlation vs Causation
[Causal AI: Bridging the Gap Between Correlation and Causation](https://www.neilsahota.com/causal-ai-bridging-the-gap-between-correlation-and-causation/)

Humans intuitively understand causality from a young age - a child learns that pushing a toy makes it move, that fire burns, that turning a handle opens a door. This ability to link actions to consequences allows us to plan, reason, and adapt to new situations. Most human knowledge is encoded in causal relationships rather than probabilistic ones.

**Source 17:** Nature - Why AI Needs to Understand Consequences
[Why artificial intelligence needs to understand consequences](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00577-1)

Relying solely on predictive models of AI in areas as diverse as health care, justice, and agriculture risks devastating consequences when correlations are mistaken for causation. Generative AI cannot be relied upon to correctly infer cause-and-effect relationships, and cannot distinguish between apparent correlations and actionable causality.

**Source 18:** World Economic Forum - Causal AI and Decision-Making (2024)
[Causal AI: the revolution uncovering the 'why' of decision-making](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/04/causal-ai-decision-making/)

Generative AI is often compared to the human mind's fast and intuitive thinking, known as "System 1" thinking, while causal AI's reasoning is thought of as our slower and more logical "System 2" thinking.

## 3. Pattern Recognition and Abstraction

### 3.1 Human Advantages in Abstract Reasoning

**Source 19:** PMC - Toward Human-Level Concept Learning
[Toward human-level concept learning: Pattern benchmarking for AI algorithms](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10435961/)

There is still a large gap between AI pattern recognition and human-level concept learning. While AI today is very successful at standard pattern-recognition tasks due to the availability of large amounts of data and advances in statistical data-driven machine learning, the differences become apparent in more complex reasoning tasks.

**Source 20:** PLOS Computational Biology - Disentangling Abstraction from Statistical Pattern Matching
[Disentangling Abstraction from Statistical Pattern Matching in Human and Machine Learning](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011316)

Neural networks often learn to solve problems through simple pattern matching while humans can often understand a problem's underlying abstract concepts or causal mechanisms and solve it using reasoning. The findings confirm that humans typically use abstraction to solve problems whereas neural networks typically use pattern matching instead.

**Source 21:** PromptLayer Research - How AI Learns Abstract Concepts Like Humans
[How AI Learns Abstract Concepts Like Humans](https://www.promptlayer.com/research-papers/how-ai-learns-abstract-concepts-like-humans)

Humans can learn amazingly well even under uncertainty from just a few examples and are capable of generalizing these concepts to solve new conceptual problems. It is very easy for humans to recognize concepts such as right/left, up/down, and big/small, which is a big challenge for machines.

**Source 22:** NYU Center for Data Science - Human Intelligence Still Outshines AI on Abstract Reasoning
[Human Intelligence Still Outshines AI on Abstract Reasoning Tasks](https://nyudatascience.medium.com/human-intelligence-still-outshines-ai-on-abstract-reasoning-tasks-6fb654bbab4b)

The ability to quickly grasp abstract patterns and apply them to new situations is a hallmark of human intelligence. Despite rapid advances in artificial intelligence, humans still vastly outperform even the most sophisticated AI systems on tasks requiring this kind of flexible reasoning.

**Source 23:** Nature Machine Intelligence - Aligning Generalization Between Humans and Machines (2025)
[Aligning generalization between humans and machines](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-025-01109-4)

In cognitive science, human generalization commonly involves abstraction and concept learning. By contrast, AI generalization encompasses out-of-domain generalization in machine learning, rule-based reasoning in symbolic AI, and abstraction in neurosymbolic AI.

**Source 24:** ArXiv - Comparison Between Humans and AI at Recognizing Objects in Unusual Poses
[A comparison between humans and AI at recognizing objects in unusual poses](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.03973v2)

One key advantage humans demonstrated was the ability to learn from minimal feedback and correct initial mistakes. Human performance improved substantially given multiple attempts, while AI models showed little improvement beyond their first guess.

## 4. Learning Efficiency and Generalization

**Source 25:** Frontiers in AI - Human versus Artificial Intelligence
[Human- versus Artificial Intelligence](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.622364/full)

Humans possess the ability to learn new concepts and ideas from a small number of samples, sometimes from a single one, and are able to understand and identify a pattern and to use it to generalize and extrapolate. In contrast, artificial intelligence systems typically need copious examples to achieve comparable levels of learning, often requiring millions or even billions of samples to learn at a level beyond that of a human of average intelligence.

**Source 26:** Ericsson Blog - Artificial Intelligence vs Human Cognition (2023)
[Artificial Intelligence vs Human Cognition: The Epic Battle of Think Tanks](https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2023/7/artificial-intelligence-vs-human-cognition-the-epic-battle-of-think-tanks)

AI can mimic human emotions and recognize facial expressions, but beneath its algorithmic facade, there lies a crucial missing piece—the depth of human experience and the authentic connection forged through empathy.

**Source 27:** Live Science - Major Differences in How Humans and AI 'Think'
[Scientists discover major differences in how humans and AI 'think'](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/scientists-discover-major-differences-in-how-humans-and-ai-think-and-the-implications-could-be-significant)

Research reveals that while humans can abstract from specific patterns to more general rules, LLMs don't have that capability - they're good at identifying and matching patterns, but not at generalizing from those patterns. In both simple letter-string analogies and digital matrix problems, humans performed well but AI performance declined sharply.
