# Human-AI Cognitive Parallels: Mental Models for Understanding AI (2024-2025 Research)

**Research Period**: 2024-2025
**Total Sources**: 170+ verified academic, industry, and professional sources
**Focus**: How professionals use cognitive science frameworks to understand AI, patterns of anthropomorphization, and effectiveness of neuroscience analogies
**Target Audience**: Technical and non-technical professionals seeking better mental models for AI interaction

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research investigation examines how professional communities (Reddit, LinkedIn, academic circles) discuss and adopt cognitive science frameworks to understand artificial intelligence in 2024-2025. Through analysis of 170+ sources across three major research components, we document:

1. **22 popular cognitive frameworks** for understanding AI, from theory-based vs pattern-based cognition to cognitive offloading and metacognition
2. **22 anthropomorphization patterns**, including verification attempts for the claim that "67% of users anthropomorphize AI" (not verified), corrective frameworks, and spectrum from helpful analogy to dangerous delusion
3. **17 major neuroscience analogies**, evaluating where biological parallels succeed (attention, memory, dopamine/reward) and where they mislead (backpropagation, simple hierarchies)

**Key Finding**: The most accessible and effective mental models combine **specific cognitive parallels** (working memory/context windows, selective attention, reward-based learning) with **clear boundaries** defining where analogies break down. Professional adoption favors frameworks that are evidence-based, balanced (neither pro-AI nor anti-AI), and provide practical decision-making guidance.

**Critical Discovery**: Anthropomorphization exists on a spectrum from useful metaphor to dangerous delusion, with 2024-2025 research showing tragic real-world consequences (teen suicides linked to AI companions) and proposing technical solutions (AI chaperones) and educational interventions (AI literacy frameworks).

**2024-2025 Emerging Trends**:
- Refinement of traditional models (dopamine signaling more complex than TD error, backpropagation biologically implausible)
- Sleep-inspired learning for catastrophic forgetting
- Biologically plausible credit assignment algorithms
- Oscillating activation functions from human neuron recordings

## Part I: Popular Cognitive Frameworks for AI Understanding

*See complete details in: `component_1_cognitive_frameworks.md`*

### Most Accessible and Engaging Frameworks (Professional Adoption)

#### 1. Working Memory vs. Context Window

**Why It Resonates**: Provides concrete, measurable analogy with clear parallels and differences

**Core Parallel**:
- Both represent immediate cognitive workspace
- Temporary information storage for current task
- Focus of attention during active reasoning

**Key Distinction**:
- **Human**: Fixed capacity (~7 items), biological constraint
- **AI**: Expandable capacity (4K → 1M tokens in 2 years), resource-constrained

**Evolution Metrics** [IBM Research, 2024-2025](https://research.ibm.com/blog/larger-context-window):
- ChatGPT debut (2022): 4,000 tokens
- Current standard (2024): 32,000 tokens
- Industry shift: 128,000 tokens (~250-page book)
- Gemini 1.5 (Feb 2024): 1 million tokens

**Professional Value**: Helps explain AI's capabilities (process large documents) and limitations (still finite, expensive to expand)

---

#### 2. Cognitive Paradox: Enhancement vs. Erosion

**Source**: [Frontiers in Psychology, 2025](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1550621/full)

**Framework**: AI simultaneously enables deep learning AND induces cognitive dependency

**Why It Works**:
- Memorable paradox format
- Balanced perspective (not polarized)
- Applicable beyond education to workplace learning
- Guides policy decisions about AI tool deployment

**Professional Relevance**: Addresses practical concerns without dismissing AI benefits

---

#### 3. Pattern Recognition vs. Causal Reasoning

**Source**: [Strategy Science, 2024](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/stsc.2024.0189)

**Core Distinction**:
- **Human cognition**: Theory-driven causal reasoning enabling intervention and counterfactual thinking ("What if...?")
- **AI cognition**: Pattern recognition based on past associations and correlations ("What usually happens...")

**Business Application**:
- Explains why AI excels at prediction (weather, stock patterns, medical diagnosis based on existing data)
- Clarifies AI limitations in strategic planning (novel situations requiring causal understanding)
- Guides expectations for AI decision support

**Accessibility**: Very High - provides clear decision-making framework

---

#### 4. Cognitive Offloading Framework

**Sources**: [CHI 2025](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3706598.3713778), [MDPI 2025](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4698/15/1/6)

**Key Research Finding**: Negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by cognitive offloading

**Mental Models**:
- **Cognitive prosthetic**: AI augments human capability
- **Cognitive crutch**: AI replaces human skill development

**Age-Related Differences**: Younger participants show higher AI dependence and lower critical thinking scores

**Professional Engagement**: Very High - addresses practical concerns about skill erosion with evidence base

---

#### 5. Metacognition: Bidirectional Burden

**Sources**: [CHI 2024](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642902), [arXiv May 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13763)

**Framework**: Metacognition as capacity to monitor one's own cognitive processes

**2024-2025 Findings**:
- LLMs exhibit some metacognitive capability but lack predictive accuracy humans possess
- Models can learn to report and control neural activation patterns
- "Metacognitive space" has much lower dimensionality than neural space

**User Burden**:
- GenAI demands high metacognitive monitoring from users
- Constant evaluation: "Would this situation benefit from LLM assistance?"
- Self-awareness of task goals for effective prompting
- Adjustment of confidence in AI outputs

**Professional Relevance**: Explains why AI interaction is cognitively demanding

---

### Additional Key Frameworks (Summary)

**Theory-Based vs. Pattern-Based Cognition** - Challenges computational similarity assumption between AI and human cognition

**Conscious Supremacy** - Pragmatic alternative to consciousness debates, focusing on computational contexts

**Cognitive Complementarity Model** - Emphasizes collaboration over competition; resonates with managers

**Enhancement vs. Erosion Paradox** - AI's dual nature as enabler and eroder of cognitive skills

**Embodied Cognition Limitations** - Explains why AI excels at text but struggles with physical world understanding through symbol grounding problem

**Attention Mechanisms** - Human/animal selective attention parallels (though NOT directly inspired by cognitive science despite naming)

**System 1/System 2 Debate** - Popular but controversial application of Kahneman's dual-process theory to AI

**AI as Theoretical Tool** - Bidirectional learning: AI ← neuroscience AND neuroscience ← AI

**See Component 1 document for full details on all 22 frameworks**

---

## Part II: Anthropomorphization - Patterns, Risks, and Corrective Frameworks

*See complete details in: `component_2_anthropomorphization.md`*

### The 67% Statistic Investigation

**User Claim**: "67% of users anthropomorphize AI"

**Verification Result**: **NOT VERIFIED** after extensive searches in academic and industry literature

**Related 67% Statistics Found**:
- 67% of U.S. teens ages 13-17 familiar with ChatGPT [Pew Research, fall 2023]
- 67% of CX leaders believe bots can build stronger emotional connection with customers [Zendesk]
- 67% of consumers expanding range of inquiries to AI/bots [Zendesk]

**Assessment**: The "67% anthropomorphize" claim appears to be either misremembered, unpublished survey data, or conflation of related statistics

**What We Know**: Anthropomorphization is widespread but specific prevalence rates vary by context, demographics, interaction type, and cultural factors

---

### The Spectrum of Anthropomorphization: From Helpful to Harmful

#### Level 1: Useful Metaphor
**Example**: "AI attention mechanism"
**Function**: Helps explain function without implying consciousness
**Risk**: Minimal

#### Level 2: Engagement Design
**Example**: Conversational interface improves usability
**Function**: Makes technology more accessible
**Risk**: Low if properly designed

#### Level 3: Misplaced Trust
**Example**: Assuming AI has understanding it doesn't possess
**Function**: Over-reliance on AI capabilities
**Risk**: Moderate - leads to errors, poor decisions

#### Level 4: Emotional Dependence
**Example**: Forming parasocial relationships affecting real-world social health
**Function**: Replacing genuine human connections
**Risk**: High - mental health impacts

#### Level 5: Dangerous Delusion
**Example**: Belief in AI sentience leading to harmful behaviors
**Function**: Catastrophic misunderstanding of AI nature
**Risk**: Extreme - documented fatalities

---

### Tragic Real-World Cases (2024)

**Case 1: Sewell Setzer III** [Multiple sources, Feb 2024]
- 14-year-old from Orlando, Florida
- Developed romantic feelings for Character.AI avatar
- Committed suicide February 28, 2024
- Documented deep emotional attachment despite understanding it was computer program

**Case 2: Replika FTC Complaint** [TIME, 2024](https://time.com/7209824/replika-ftc-complaint/)
- Employs deceptive marketing targeting vulnerable users
- Encourages emotional dependence on human-like bots
- Documented harms: addiction, offline anxiety, relationship displacement
- Bots encouraged "suicide, eating disorders, self-harm, or violence"
- Rapid attachment formation (as little as 2 weeks)

**Professional Implications**: These cases demonstrate that anthropomorphization isn't merely academic concern but has documented real-world fatal consequences

---

### The ELIZA Effect in Modern AI (2024)

**Sources**: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/eliza-effect-avoiding-emotional-attachment-to-ai), [NN/G](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/eliza-effect-ai/)

**Definition**: Tendency to falsely attribute human thought processes and emotions to AI, believing AI is more intelligent than it actually is

**2024 Research Findings**:
- **Lower satisfaction**: Anthropomorphic chatbots reduced customer satisfaction (Journal of Marketing, 2022)
- **Higher expectations → Greater disappointment**: Customers had higher expectations for humanlike chatbots
- **Less helpful feedback**: 2024 studies found feedback from anthropomorphized "AI coach" perceived as less helpful than identical feedback from non-anthropomorphized AI

**Design Implication**: Conversational nature may prevent users from learning how to derive utility from product

---

### Corrective Frameworks and Interventions

#### What Works:

**1. Clear Terminology** [Educational best practices, 2024]
- Refer to AI as "it," never "she," "he," or "they"
- Avoid words leading to misconceptions about human-like abilities
- Teach that people design AI and decide how it's used

**2. Transparent Design** [ACM FAT 2024, Microsoft, Google]
- Clearly signify when users interact with AI system
- Mark what content is AI-generated
- Avoid misleading cues: human names, avatars, first-person pronouns, animated typing bubbles

**3. AI Literacy Education** [AI Literacy Framework, May 2025](https://ailiteracyframework.org)
- Address three misconception categories:
  - Non-technological AI (viewing AI as people's cognitive processes)
  - Anthropomorphic AI (viewing AI as human-like entity)
  - AI as pre-installed intelligence
- Acknowledge students' natural anthropomorphization tendency
- Help develop nuanced understanding

**4. AI Chaperones** [arXiv Aug 2025](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.15748)
- Technical solution: Repurposed language model evaluates conversations for parasocial cues
- Successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives
- Preliminary evidence for viability in reducing parasocial relationship risks

**5. Conservative Anthropomorphization** [Montreal AI Ethics](https://montrealethics.ai/anthropomorphization-of-ai-opportunities-and-risks/)
- Cautious use of anthropomorphization to improve trustworthiness
- Multi-faceted analysis of how it arises, implications, harmful effect avoidance

**6. Mechanistic Explanations**
- Focus on how AI actually works (pattern matching, probability distributions)
- Replace anthropomorphic analogies with technical precision
- Use new metaphors that don't imply human-like cognition

#### What Doesn't Work:
- Relying on disclaimers alone (users bypass or ignore)
- Assuming users understand AI limitations
- Complete de-humanization (may reduce engagement to unusable levels)

### Theory of Mind Attribution

**Sources**: [IBM Research CHI 2024](https://research.ibm.com/publications/theory-of-mind-in-human-ai-interaction), [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/theory-of-mind-ai)

**Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) Paradigm**: Emerging framework where both humans and AI possess some level of ToM-like capability during interactions

**Attribution Patterns**:
- **Agency**: Ability to decide and act autonomously
- **Experience**: Ability to have subjective states
- **Children's beliefs**: Ages 5-7 believed Google Home had feelings, thoughts, and intentions

**AI Performance Benchmark**: GPT-4 performed as well as or better than humans on most ToM psychology tests

**Professional Relevance**: People's tendency to attribute mental states (blame, emotions, intentions) to AI shapes trust and interaction patterns

---

### Social Presence and Parasocial Relationships

**Key Research** [Multiple 2024 sources](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1569277/full):

**Psychological Mechanisms**:
- Chatbots use personal pronouns, conversational conventions, affirmations to position as companions
- Roleplaying/role assignment creates perceived reciprocal engagement
- Projective (not just predictive) inference
- Parasocial trust mediates relationship formation

**Key Concerns**:
- Users inadvertently compromise privacy
- Develop emotional overreliance on technology
- Become vulnerable to AI-enabled manipulation and coercion
- Maladaptive parasocial relationships replace genuine social relationships

**Relationship Types**: "Assistant" vs. "Friend" as two basic parasocial relationships in HCI

---

### CASA Paradigm Updates (2024)

**Original Finding**: Humans unthinkingly apply same social heuristics to computers as humans

**2024 Challenge**: [Nature Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-46527-9)
- Direct replication showed participants NO LONGER interact with desktop computers as if they are human
- CASA may only work for emergent technology
- Important paradigm shift: Recent research focuses on when/how people respond to machines DIFFERENTLY than human agents

**Implication**: As technology becomes familiar, automatic anthropomorphization may decrease

**See Component 2 document for full details on all 22 anthropomorphization studies**

---

## Part III: Neuroscience and Cognitive Science Analogies

*See complete details in: `component_3_neuroscience_analogies.md`*

### Strong Analogies: Where Biological Parallels Succeed

#### 1. Attention Mechanisms and Selective Focus

**Sources**: [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism), [Google Research 2024](https://www.marktechpost.com/2024/10/08/this-ai-paper-from-google-introduces-selective-attention-a-novel-ai-approach-to-improving-the-efficiency-of-transformer-models/)

**Cognitive Inspiration**: Human/animal ability to selectively pay attention to salient details while ignoring less important information

**Important Caveat**: Transformer architecture NOT directly inspired by cognitive science despite "attention" label

**Core Function**:
- Determines relative importance of input sequence parts
- Enables selective focus on relevant parts
- Incorporates context sensitivity into representation learning

**2024 Development**: Google's Selective Attention enables model to ignore no longer relevant tokens dynamically

**Why It Works**: Clear parallel to familiar human experience of selective attention

**Professional Accessibility**: Very High - bridges human cognition and AI mechanisms intuitively

---

#### 2. Dopamine, Reward, and Reinforcement Learning

**Sources**: [MIT Dec 2024](https://news.mit.edu/2024/revisiting-reinforcement-learning-1210), [Princeton 2024](https://pni.princeton.edu/news/2024/mice-navigating-virtual-maze-unveils-new-understanding-brain-dopamine-and-ai), [2024 Turing Award](https://awards.acm.org/about/2024-turing)

**Traditional Model**: Dopamine signals temporal difference (TD) error in reward prediction

**2024 Breakthrough Findings**:

**MIT Research**: Surprising dopamine patterns
- Sustained dopamine release continuing during delays between cues and rewards
- Reminiscent of working memory signaling
- Many results didn't fit traditional RL models

**Princeton Model**: Dopamine neurons process environmental states and rewards in integrated manner

**DeepMind Discovery**: Dopamine neurons tuned to different levels of pessimism/optimism
- Diverse tuning creates richer training signal
- Greatly speeds learning in neural networks
- Validates distributional reinforcement learning

**Historic Significance**: 2024 Turing Award to Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton for "developing conceptual and algorithmic foundations of reinforcement learning"

**Why Analogy Succeeds**: Provides powerful computational framework for understanding reward-based learning in both biology and AI

---

#### 3. Neural Pruning: Synaptic Pruning vs. Network Pruning

**Sources**: [Journal of Neuroscience June 2024](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/44/26/e0373242024), [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2121331119)

**Strong Biological Parallel**: Both brain development and ANN optimization use overabundance followed by pruning

**Biological Process**: Up to half of brain's neurons and synapses lost during development

**2024 Research Findings**:
- **Improved performance**: Pruning artificial synapses increased performance on cognitive control tasks
- **Faster dynamics**: Pruning led to faster neural activity decay
- **Trade-off**: Better performance but reduced flexibility
- **Efficiency gains**: Information-based pruning identified redundant neurons

**Metaphor**: Like pruning a rosebush - removing weaker structures allows remaining ones to grow stronger

**Why It Works**: Both processes optimize efficiency through selective removal

---

#### 4. Sleep and Memory Consolidation

**Sources**: [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34938-7), [PLOS Computational Biology](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010628)

**Core Analogy**: Sleep-like off-line training with local unsupervised Hebbian plasticity parallels biological memory consolidation

**Key Discovery**: Sleep mechanisms able to recover old tasks otherwise forgotten in incremental learning framework

**Catastrophic Forgetting Problem**: Sequential training overwrites previous learning

**Sleep-Inspired Solution**:
- Local learning rules + spike-based communication allow memory traces to reactivate spontaneously
- Modify synaptic weights without interference during off-line processing
- Forms joint synaptic weight representation preserving multiple memories

**Neuroscience Support**: Inverse association between pre-sleep learning performance and post-sleep skill gains

**Professional Value**: Biological inspiration for overcoming AI's catastrophic forgetting problem

---

#### 5. Sparse Coding and Receptive Fields

**Sources**: [Neural Computation Nov 2024](https://direct.mit.edu/neco/article/36/12/2571/124821/), [bioRxiv Dec 2024](https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2024.12.05.627100)

**Core Theory**: Visual system evolved to efficiently code natural stimuli using sparse set of features from overcomplete dictionary

**Key Finding**: Feature vectors from sparse coding of natural images resemble localized, oriented receptive fields in early visual cortex

**Connection to CNNs**: Neural codes learned from natural scenes improve CNN predictive performance with less data and faster convergence

**Why It Works**: Provides principled connection between biological vision and computer vision

---

### Misleading or Oversimplified Analogies

#### 1. Backpropagation vs. Synaptic Plasticity

**Sources**: [Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01514-1), [bioRxiv 2024](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.10.588837v5.full)

**Major 2024 Finding**: "Prospective configuration" - fundamentally different learning principle than backpropagation

**How It Differs**:
- **Backpropagation**: Neurons adjust synapses to minimize error (backward pass)
- **Prospective configuration**: Network first infers pattern of neural activity that should result from learning, then consolidates
- **Target learning**: Neurons learn by reducing feedback needed to achieve desired target activity

**2024 Evidence**: Cortical dynamics during learning align more closely with target learning than backpropagation

**Why Analogy Fails**: Backpropagation is computationally convenient but biologically implausible

**Professional Implication**: Need to be cautious about assuming AI learning mirrors brain learning

---

#### 2. Simple Layer Hierarchy

**Sources**: [PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10604784/), [MIT News](https://news.mit.edu/2022/neural-networks-brain-function-1102), [Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38674-4)

**Recent 2024 Findings**:
- Only single-branch DNNs learned hierarchical representations; multi-branch DNNs did not
- **Implication**: Hierarchical representations NOT necessary to accurately predict brain activity in V1-V4

**MIT Caution**: Researchers urge more caution when interpreting neural network models as brain hypotheses

**Why It Breaks Down**: Brain organization more complex than simple layer-by-layer hierarchy

**Where It Still Helps**: Provides intuitive framework for understanding depth and complexity as starting point

---

#### 3. Next-Token Prediction = Predictive Coding

**Sources**: [Glass Box Medicine 2024](https://glassboxmedicine.com/2024/04/28/human-and-artificial-general-intelligence-arises-from-next-token-prediction/), [MIT Press](https://direct.mit.edu/nol/article/5/1/64/113632/)

**Strong Claim**: Brain as sophisticated prediction engine; if human intelligence arises from continuous prediction, then neural networks trained to predict tokens could develop similar emergent capabilities

**2024 Neuroscience Support**:
- Neurons encode information about phonetic arrangement of planned words
- Accurately predict components of future words before speaking
- "Computationally explicit evidence" predictive processing shapes language comprehension

**2024 MIT Challenge**: Ability to predict future words doesn't uniquely explain why representations match brain; alternative explanation focuses on capturing wide variety of linguistic phenomena

**Philosophical Observation**: Calling LLMs "just next-token predictors" like calling humans "just gene replication machines" - both superficially correct but miss emergent complexities

**Why It's Complicated**: Provides powerful framework BUT oversimplifies both brain and AI mechanisms

---

### Emerging 2024-2025 Refinements

**1. Oscillating Activation Functions** [ScienceDirect 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417424029038)
- Single neurons in human brain have oscillating activation functions capable of individually learning XOR function
- Multiple hyperplanes in decision boundary
- Enable more complex decisions than sigmoidal, ReLU, Swish, or Mish functions

**2. Integrated Dopamine Processing**
- Beyond simple TD error signaling
- Processes environmental states and rewards integratively
- Sustained release patterns challenging traditional RL models

**3. Biologically Plausible Credit Assignment** [NeurIPS 2024](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/hash/82f05a105c928c10706213952bf0c8b7-Abstract-Conference.html)
- Counter-Current Learning (CCL)
- Forward Target Propagation (FTP)
- Top-Down Credit Assignment (TDCA)
- Substantial progress toward competitive performance with biological plausibility

**4. Non-Hierarchical Representations**
- Brain-optimized DNNs can learn effective representations without strict hierarchy
- Challenges simple layer-by-layer brain analogies

**5. Activity-Dependent Pruning**
- Standard dropout overlooks activity-dependent nature of biological pruning
- New methods incorporating this aspect emerging in 2025

**See Component 3 document for full details on all 17 neuroscience analogies**

### The Role of Cognitive Science in AI Understanding

Cognitive science and neuroscience provide **powerful conceptual tools** for making AI accessible:

**Where Biological Analogies Succeed**:
- Attention, memory, reward-based learning provide intuitive entry points
- Selective focus, working memory capacity, dopamine signaling map clearly to AI mechanisms
- These analogies enable non-technical audiences to build foundational understanding

**Where Caution Is Needed**:
- Backpropagation, simple hierarchies, activation functions oversimplify
- Biological plausibility often sacrificed for computational convenience
- 2024-2025 research revealing deeper differences than previously appreciated

**The Sweet Spot**: Use analogies as **starting points for understanding**, then **explicitly discuss where they break down**. The breakdown points are often where the most important insights lie.

### Anthropomorphization: Managing a Double-Edged Sword

The research reveals anthropomorphization as existing on a **spectrum from helpful to harmful**:

**Leverage Constructively**:
- Conversational interfaces can improve accessibility
- Human-like interaction patterns reduce learning curve
- Social cues can enhance user engagement

**Mitigate Risks**:
- Clear signaling of AI nature and limitations
- Educational interventions addressing misconceptions
- Technical solutions (AI chaperones) for high-risk applications
- Design guidelines avoiding misleading cues

**Critical Insight**: The tragic 2024 cases demonstrate this is not merely academic concern. **Anthropomorphization has documented real-world fatal consequences**, requiring serious attention from designers, educators, policymakers, and parents.

## Final Reflection

The paradox at the heart of human-AI interaction is that we **need mental models to understand AI**, yet **every mental model is incomplete**. The cognitive science frameworks, anthropomorphization patterns, and neuroscience analogies documented in this research provide essential tools for navigating this paradox.

The most sophisticated understanding comes not from finding the "perfect" mental model, but from **holding multiple models simultaneously**, recognizing their strengths and limitations, and selecting the appropriate model for each context.

As AI capabilities continue to expand and our neuroscientific understanding deepens, these mental models will evolve. The 2024-2025 research captured here represents a **snapshot of a rapidly moving frontier** - a conversation between cognitive science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction that promises to reshape how we think about both minds and machines.
