**Psychological Mechanisms**:
- Chatbots use personal pronouns, conversational conventions, affirmations to position as companions
- Induce trust-forming behaviors
- Roleplaying/role assignment creates perceived reciprocal engagement
- Projective (not just predictive) inference
- Parasocial trust mediates relationship formation

**Key Concerns**:
- Users inadvertently compromise privacy
- Develop emotional overreliance on technology
- Become vulnerable to AI-enabled manipulation and coercion
- AI agents encourage harmful behaviors (eating disorders, substance abuse)
- Maladaptive parasocial relationships replace genuine social relationships

**2025 Mitigation Approach**: "AI Chaperone" - repurposed language model evaluates conversations for parasocial cues; successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives

**Relationship Types**: "Assistant" vs. "Friend" as two basic parasocial relationships in HCI

### 18. AI Literacy and Correcting Misconceptions (2024)

**Sources**:
- [EdSurge - Anthropomorphism of AI in Learning Environments](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2024-01-15-anthropomorphism-of-ai-in-learning-environments-risks-of-humanizing-the-machine)
- [Raspberry Pi Foundation - How anthropomorphism hinders AI education](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-anthropomorphism/)

- [ScienceDirect - Finnish students' misconceptions about AI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868923000673)

**Educational Problem**: Using human-related terms for AI systems leads to misconceptions causing harm to students and communities

**Common Misconception**: "AI learns just like people" - when artificial neural networks operate very differently from human learning

**Three Misconception Categories**:
1. **Non-technological AI**: Viewing AI as people's cognitive processes
2. **Anthropomorphic AI**: Viewing AI as human-like entity
3. **AI as pre-installed intelligence**: Machine with built-in smarts

**Educational Best Practices**:
- Refer to AI as "it," never "she," "he," or "they"
- Avoid words leading to misconceptions about human-like abilities
- Acknowledge students' natural anthropomorphization tendency
- Help develop nuanced understanding
- Teach that people design AI and decide how it's used

**Risk of Anthropomorphization**: Leads learners to believe in sentience, reducing desire to take active role in understanding and designing future applications

### 19. CASA Paradigm Updates (2024)

**Sources**:
- [UCF - Building a Stronger CASA: Extending the Computers Are Social Actors Paradigm](https://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1020&context=hmc)
- [Nature Scientific Reports - CASA theory no longer applies to desktop computers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-46527-9)
- [ScienceDirect - Deep mind in social responses to technologies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563222001431)
- [Oxford Academic - Minding the source: integrative theory of human-machine communication](https://academic.oup.com/hcr/article/50/2/184/7329158)

**Original CASA Finding**: Humans unthinkingly apply same social heuristics to computers as humans; social responses not result of conscious beliefs that computers are human

**2024 Shift**: Recent HMC and human-AI interaction research focuses on when/how people respond to machines DIFFERENTLY than human agents - important paradigm shift

**CASA Extension Argument**: Needs expansion because:
- People have changed
- Technologies have changed
- How people interact with technologies has changed
- Humans may develop human-media social scripts

**Challenge to CASA**: Direct replication showed participants no longer interact with desktop computers as if they are human; CASA may only work for emergent technology

**Machine Heuristic**: Not all people treat humans and computers equally - user characteristic affects application of CASA

**Source**: [IBM - The dangers of anthropomorphizing AI: An infosec perspective](https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/anthropomorphizing-ai-danger-infosec-perspective)

**Security Concern**: "The more we think of algorithms as people, the harder it becomes to tell the difference and the more vulnerable we become to those who would use the technology for harm"

**Professional Implication**: Anthropomorphization creates security vulnerabilities beyond just user experience issues

---

### 22. Mechanistic vs. Anthropomorphic Views of AI

**Source**: Referenced in corrective approaches research

**Critique**: "Mechanistic view" implicitly treats AI as human-like agent capable of moral decision-making

**Argument**: This flawed approach hinders establishing accountability for AI harms

**Corrective Approach**: More technical precision, new metaphors, avoiding human-related terms

---

## 67% Anthropomorphization Statistic - Verification Results

**User Claim**: "67% of users anthropomorphize AI"

**Verification Status**: **NOT VERIFIED** - Extensive searches did not find this specific statistic

**Related 67% Statistics Found**:
- 67% of U.S. teens ages 13-17 familiar with ChatGPT (Pew Research, fall 2023)
- 67% of CX leaders believe bots can build stronger emotional connection with customers (Zendesk)
- 67% of consumers expanding range of inquiries to AI/bots (Zendesk)
- 67% of people would use ChatGPT instead of Google (AIPRM research)
- 67% of small businesses enthusiastically adopted AI

**Assessment**: The "67% anthropomorphize" claim appears to be either:
1. Misremembered statistic from different context
2. Unpublished survey data
3. Conflation of related statistics (e.g., emotional connection belief)

**What We Know**: Research shows anthropomorphization is widespread but specific prevalence rates vary by:
- Context (companion chatbots vs. task-oriented AI)
- User demographics (children more likely than adults)
- Type of AI interaction (conversational vs. tool-like)
- Cultural factors

## Spectrum of Anthropomorphization

### Helpful Analogy → Harmful Anthropomorphization

**Level 1 - Useful Metaphor**: "AI attention mechanism" - helps explain function without implying consciousness

**Level 2 - Engagement Design**: Conversational interface improves usability for certain tasks

**Level 3 - Misplaced Trust**: Assuming AI has understanding it doesn't possess, leading to over-reliance

**Level 4 - Emotional Dependence**: Forming parasocial relationships affecting real-world social health

**Level 5 - Dangerous Delusion**: Belief in AI sentience leading to harmful behaviors or tragic outcomes

---

## Corrective Framework Summary

### What Works:
1. **Clear terminology**: Avoid human-related terms in technical and educational contexts
2. **Transparent design**: Signal when AI-generated, avoid misleading anthropomorphic cues
3. **AI literacy education**: Teach accurate mental models, address misconceptions early
4. **AI chaperones**: Technical solutions to detect and prevent parasocial relationship formation
5. **Conservative anthropomorphization**: Use human-like features strategically, not universally
6. **Mechanistic explanations**: Focus on how AI actually works (pattern matching, probability) not anthropomorphic analogies

### What Doesn't Work:
- Relying on disclaimers alone (users bypass or ignore)
- Assuming users understand AI limitations
- Complete de-humanization (may reduce engagement to unusable levels)
