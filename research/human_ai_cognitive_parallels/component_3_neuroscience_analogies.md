- [Nature Communications - Brain-optimized DNNs learn non-hierarchical representations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38674-4)

**Traditional Analogy**: ANN layers map to brain organization: nodes → neurons, layers → regions, networks → brain networks

**Recent Findings (2024)**:
- DNNs optimized for visual tasks align layer depth with hierarchy of visual areas in primate brain
- **Challenge**: Only single-branch DNNs learned hierarchical representations; multi-branch DNNs did not
- **Implication**: Hierarchical representations not necessary to accurately predict brain activity in V1-V4

**Brain Hierarchy Score**: Metric computing degree of hierarchical homology across ANN layers and brain areas

**Caution**: MIT researchers urge more caution when interpreting neural network models as brain hypotheses

**Where Analogy Succeeds**: Provides intuitive framework for understanding depth and complexity

- [PMC - Predictive coding networks with local Hebbian plasticity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11881729/)

**Major 2024 Finding**: "Prospective configuration" - fundamentally different learning principle than backpropagation

**How It Differs**:
- **Backpropagation**: Neurons adjust synapses to minimize error (backward pass)
- **Prospective configuration**: Network first infers pattern of neural activity that should result from learning, then consolidates with synaptic weight changes
- **Target learning**: Neurons learn by reducing feedback needed to achieve desired target activity

**2024 Evidence**: Cortical dynamics during learning align more closely with target learning than backpropagation

**Self-Backpropagation Discovery**: Synaptic modification at output synapses backpropagates to input synapses, markedly reducing computational cost

**Predictive Coding Networks**: Can perform supervised learning using only local Hebbian plasticity

**Professional Relevance**: Biological learning mechanisms operate quite differently from artificial backpropagation

**Where Analogy Fails**: Backpropagation is computationally convenient but biologically implausible

- [Nature Human Behaviour - Evidence of predictive coding hierarchy in brain listening to speech](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01516-2)

**Strong Analogy**: Brain as sophisticated prediction engine - Active Inference (Predictive Coding) framework suggests brain constantly predicts sensory data and updates based on prediction error

**2024 Neuroscience Evidence**:
- Neurons encode detailed information about phonetic arrangement of planned words
- Accurately predict components of future words before speaking
- "Computationally explicit evidence" that predictive processing shapes language comprehension

**Philosophical Implication**: If human intelligence arises from continuous prediction and error minimization, neural networks trained to predict tokens could develop similar emergent capabilities

**Counterargument**: Calling LLMs "just next-token predictors" like calling humans "just gene replication machines" - both superficially correct but miss emergent complexities

**2024 MIT Challenge**: Ability to predict future words doesn't uniquely explain why representations match brain; alternative explanation focuses on capturing wide variety of linguistic phenomena

**Where Analogy Succeeds**: Provides powerful framework connecting human cognition and AI capabilities

**Where It May Mislead**: Oversimplifies both brain and AI mechanisms

- **GPU advantage**: Process multiple operations simultaneously, overcoming complexity

**2024 Developments**:

- **Intel Hala Point**: World's largest neuromorphic system using Loihi 2 processors
- **GPU performance**: Dendritic Hierarchical Scheduling 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than classic serial methods

**Where Analogy Works**: Both leverage massive parallelism for computational efficiency

**Where It Breaks Down**: Brain's distributed computation fundamentally different from GPU architecture; neurons communicate via spikes, GPUs via voltage levels

- [PLOS Computational Biology - Information theory of developmental pruning](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009458)

**Strong Biological Parallel**: Both brain development and ANN optimization use overabundance followed by pruning

**Biological Process**: Up to half of brain's neurons and synapses lost during development; pruning reallocates resources to remaining structures

**2024 Research Findings**:
- **Improved performance**: Pruning artificial synapses increased performance on cognitive control tasks
- **Faster dynamics**: Pruning led to faster neural activity decay
- **Trade-off**: Better performance but reduced flexibility
- **Efficiency gains**: Information-based pruning identified redundant neurons, creating more compact networks

**Like Pruning a Rosebush**: Removing weaker structures allows remaining ones to grow stronger and more stable

**Recent Innovation (2025)**: Standard dropout regularization overlooks activity-dependent nature of biological pruning; new methods incorporate this aspect

**Where Analogy Works**: Both processes optimize efficiency through selective removal

**Where Caution Needed**: Biological pruning activity-dependent; most AI pruning methods are not

- [DataCamp - Introduction to Activation Functions in Neural Networks](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-activation-functions-in-neural-networks)

**Biological Basis**: Activation function abstracts rate of action potential firing in neurons

- **Rate limitation**: Neurons can't fire faster than certain rate (motivates sigmoid with finite interval)
- **Non-linearity**: Firing is not linear response to stimuli

**Major 2024 Discovery**: Single neurons in human brain have oscillating activation functions capable of individually learning XOR function

**Oscillating Activation Functions**:
- Multiple hyperplanes in decision boundary
- Enable neurons to make more complex decisions than sigmoidal, ReLU, Swish, or Mish functions
- Directly inspired by biological neuron capabilities

**ReLU Advantage**: Mimics firing threshold, computationally efficient (only certain neurons activated), less susceptible to vanishing gradient problem

**Where Analogy Succeeds**: Threshold behavior, non-linearity provide strong parallel

**Where It Simplifies**: Real neurons far more complex - timing, chemical signaling, dendritic computation not captured

- **Deep neural networks**: Almost completely lack continual learning ability

**Biological Mechanisms for Stability**:
- Mammalian brain protects previously acquired knowledge in neocortical circuits
- When mouse acquires new skill, dendritic spine volume increases
- **Critical**: Enlarged spines persist despite subsequent learning of other tasks
- Re-occurrence of neuronal activity patterns believed important for memory stabilization

**Stability-Plasticity Dilemma**: Reduced forgetting comes at cost of impaired ability to learn new information

**2024 Solution Approaches**: TS-ACL (Fan et al., 2024) - analytical continual learning framework achieving optimal balance between stability and plasticity

**Where Brain Excels**: Elegant solution to stability-plasticity dilemma through structural synaptic changes

**Challenge for AI**: Replicating biological memory protection mechanisms
