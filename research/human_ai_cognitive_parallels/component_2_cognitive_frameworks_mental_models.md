## 1. Mental Models and Explainable AI (XAI)

### 1.1 Mental Models Definition and Framework

**Source 1:** BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making - Mental Models Approach for XAI (2021)
[A mental models approach for defining explainable artificial intelligence](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-021-01703-7)

Explainability should be defined in terms of the context of the model, comprising the purpose, audience, and language of the model and explanation. Mental models are people's understanding of how something works and help set expectations for what a product can and can't do.

**Source 2:** ACM Digital Library - Capturing Humans' Mental Models of AI (2023)
[Capturing Humans' Mental Models of AI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3593013.3594111)

Researchers proposed a framework based on item response theory for modeling how humans perceive AI teammates, extending relevant work from cognitive science. Improving our understanding of how humans perceive AI teammates is an important foundation for our general understanding of human-AI teams.

**Source 3:** Frontiers in Neuroscience - Cognitive Psychology-Based AI Review (2022)
[Cognitive psychology-based artificial intelligence review](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.1024316/full)

Cognitive psychology has been very instructive for the development of AI, and current AI design makes extensive reference to human cognitive models. The process of human mental activity is simulated in various aspects such as attention, encoding, and memory.

**Source 4:** IBM Design Medium - Design for AI: Understanding Mental Models
[Design for AI: Understanding Mental Models](https://medium.com/design-ibm/design-for-ai-understanding-mental-models-6af190ef2cd5)

Expert AI developers may not need high-level explanations, while less experienced developers may need guidance that can help them build comprehensive and accurate mental models of how AI works. Understanding users' mental models allows designers to create responsible, transparent, and personalized experiences.

### 1.2 XAI and User Understanding Research (2024)

**Source 5:** ArXiv - Improving User Mental Models of XAI Systems (April 2024)
[Improving User Mental Models of XAI Systems with an Inclusive Design Approach](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.13217v2)

Recent 2024 research used the GenderMag inclusivity method to improve XAI systems, conducting a study with 69 participants to assess their predictions, ability to detect AI flaws, perception of AI behavior, and mental models.

**Source 6:** Frontiers in Computer Science - Measures for Explainable AI (2023)
[Measures for explainable AI: Explanation goodness, user satisfaction, mental models, curiosity, trust, and human-AI performance](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2023.1096257/full)

Methods have been developed for XAI researchers to reveal user's mental model of an AI system, along with assessing explanation goodness, user satisfaction, curiosity, trust, and human-XAI work system performance.

**Source 7:** INFORMS Information Systems Research - Impact of XAI on Information Processing (2023)
[Expl(AI)ned: The Impact of Explainable Artificial Intelligence on Users' Information Processing](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/isre.2023.1199)

Prior research has not adequately considered the potential consequences of providing explanations for users' situational information processing and mental models (cognitive representations that encode beliefs, facts, and knowledge). The creation of misleading explanations may not only affect users' trust in the AI system but also lead to an asymmetric adjustment of mental models that affect users' decision making.

## 2. Attention Mechanisms: Human vs Transformer Architecture

### 2.1 Cognitive Science of Attention

**Source 9:** PMC - Role of Selective Attention on Academic Foundations
[The role of selective attention on academic foundations: A cognitive neuroscience perspective](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3375497/)

Selective attention is the ability to enhance relevant signals and manage distraction. More specifically, selective attention is the process of directing our awareness to relevant stimuli while ignoring irrelevant stimuli in the environment.

**Source 10:** PMC - Mechanisms of Attention: Psychophysics, Cognitive Psychology, and Neuroscience
[Mechanisms of attention: Psychophysics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2879667/)

Attention solves the problem of information overload in cognitive processing systems by selecting some information for further processing, or by managing resources applied to several sources of information simultaneously. A growing body of neuroimaging research has identified a frontoparietal attention network which appears to be responsible for control of attention.

**Source 11:** Simply Psychology - Selective Attention Theory
[Selective Attention Theory: Broadbent & Treisman's Attenuation Model](https://www.simplypsychology.org/attention-models.html)

Broadbent's Filter Theory proposes that the physical characteristics of messages are used to select one message for further processing and that all others are lost. Treisman's Attenuation Model refined this theory.

### 2.2 Transformer Attention vs Human Attention

**Source 12:** ArXiv - From Cognition to Computation (July 2024)
[From Cognition to Computation: A Comparative Review of Human Attention and Transformer Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01548)

Despite the shared fundamental principle of selectively attending to information, human attention and the Transformer model display notable differences, particularly in their capacity constraints, attention pathways, and intentional mechanisms.

**Source 13:** MIT Open Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science - Transformers
[Transformers](https://oecs.mit.edu/pub/ppxhxe2b/release/1)

Unlike CNNs, which were inspired by the architecture of the mammalian primary visual cortex, the transformer architecture was not directly inspired by insights from cognitive scienceâ€”despite the potentially misleading choice of "attention" as the label for its central mechanism. However, researchers have become increasingly interested in transformers' potential to shed light on aspects of human cognition.

**Source 14:** Frontiers in Computer Science - Self-Attention in Vision Transformers (2023)
[Self-attention in vision transformers performs perceptual grouping, not attention](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computer-science/articles/10.3389/fcomp.2023.1178450/full)

Research investigating whether attention mechanisms in vision transformers exhibit effects similar to human visual attention found that computationally, these models perform a special class of relaxation labeling with similarity grouping effects, despite the name.

**Source 15:** IBM - What is an Attention Mechanism?
[What is an attention mechanism?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/attention-mechanism)

Attention mechanisms are inspired by the ability of humans to selectively pay more attention to salient details and ignore less important information, which helps ensure no meaningful details are lost while enabling efficient use of limited memory and time.

## 3. Memory Systems: Human Cognition and AI Implementation

### 3.1 Human Memory Systems Architecture

**Source 16:** ArXiv - Memory-Augmented Transformers (August 2024)
[Memory-Augmented Transformers: A Systematic Review from Neuroscience Principles](https://arxiv.org/html/2508.10824v1)

Memory-augmented Transformers mirror human memory architecture by leveraging embeddings, attention mechanisms, and advanced encoding and retrieval techniques to construct feature maps (analogous to short-term memory), attention contexts (analogous to working memory), and parametric or non-parametric memory (analogous to long-term memory). Human memory consists of three interacting subsystems: sensory memory, working memory, and long-term memory.

**Source 17:** LangGraph Documentation - Memory Management
[LangGraph Memory Management - Overview](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/)

Humans use memories to remember facts (semantic memory), experiences (episodic memory), and rules (procedural memory), and AI agents can use memory in the same ways.

**Source 18:** DigitalOcean Community - Understanding Episodic Memory in AI
[Understanding Episodic Memory in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/episodic-memory-in-ai)

Episodic memory, in both humans and AI agents, involves recalling past events or actions. Episodic memory allows AI agents to recall specific past experiences, similar to how humans remember individual events.

### 3.2 AI Memory Implementation (2024)

**Source 19:** IBM Research - How Memory Augmentation Can Improve LLMs
[How memory augmentation can improve large language models](https://research.ibm.com/blog/memory-augmented-LLMs)

Context windows can function as a kind of working memory, but LLMs lack long-term memory, and the transformer architectures that underlie LLMs struggle to keep things straight when dealing with long input sequences. Drawing from neuroscience lessons, researchers wanted to add a form of short-term memory to LLMs, leading to the creation of Larimar, which works as an episodic memory controller. If a conventional LLM is like the brain's neocortex, which learns slowly and holds memories for a long time, then Larimar is like the hippocampus, which holds short-term memories.

**Source 20:** MarkTechPost - Advanced AI Agent with Short-Term and Long-Term Memory (2025)
[How to Build an Advanced AI Agent with Summarized Short-Term and Vector-Based Long-Term Memory](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/09/02/how-to-build-an-advanced-ai-agent-with-summarized-short-term-and-vector-based-long-term-memory/)

Current research typically divides human memory into three main types: working memory, short-term memory, and LTM, where working memory and short-term memory mainly contain temporary information related to current tasks or situations, which is quickly forgotten if not processed and transformed into LTM.

**Source 21:** Towards Data Science - Agentic AI: Implementing Long-Term Memory
[Agentic AI: Implementing Long-Term Memory](https://towardsdatascience.com/agentic-ai-implementing-long-term-memory/)

Transformer-based LLMs inherently do not retain or recall any previous state or sequence, which limits the model's ability to carry LTM information but only short-term "working memory" for the current context window.

**Source 22:** Medium - Semantic vs Episodic vs Procedural Memory in AI Agents
[Semantic vs Episodic vs Procedural Memory in AI Agents](https://medium.com/womenintechnology/semantic-vs-episodic-vs-procedural-memory-in-ai-agents-and-why-you-need-all-three-8479cd1c7ba6)

AI systems use semantic memory to retain and recall facts and general knowledge from the training materials. AI agents typically implement semantic memory using knowledge bases, symbolic AI or vector embeddings, allowing them to process and retrieve relevant information efficiently.

## 4. Cognitive Architecture and Neuroscience-Inspired AI

### 4.1 Brain-Inspired AI Architectures (2024)

**Source 23:** Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience - Emergence of Enhanced Intelligence (2024)
[The emergence of enhanced intelligence in a brain-inspired cognitive architecture](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1367712/full)

The Causal Cognitive Architecture is a brain-inspired cognitive architecture developed from the hypothesis that navigation circuits in mammalian ancestors duplicated to form the neocortex. Research shows that by enhancing feedback pathways, causal reasoning, analogical inductive reasoning, and compositional language readily emerge from this architecture.

**Source 24:** SSRN - AI Meets the Brain (2024)
[AI Meets the Brain: Integrating Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Principles into Artificial Intelligence](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5019283)

Key integration concepts include neuroplasticityâ€”the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connectionsâ€”which can inform algorithms that allow AI systems to learn continuously and adapt without catastrophic forgetting. Decision-making mechanisms in the human brain, particularly how reinforcement learning is influenced by dopamine systems, can enhance reward structures in AI algorithms.

**Source 25:** BMC Neuroscience - New Era in Cognitive Neuroscience (2024)
[A new era in cognitive neuroscience: the tidal wave of artificial intelligence (AI)](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12868-024-00869-w)

Neuroscience and AI are mutually interrelated and benefit one another, with theoretical neuroscience bringing distinct improvisations into AI. The rapid developments of modern AI models are largely dependent on understanding neural architecture, with deep learning established by mathematically conceptualizing neurons and synaptic strengths.

**Source 26:** Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience - Artificial Cognition vs AI (2024)
[Artificial cognition vs. artificial intelligence for next-generation autonomous robotic agents](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2024.1349408/full)

A brain-inspired, embodied cognitive approach aims at full integration of "Bodyware and Cogniware" for next-generation autonomous robotic agents with cognitive capabilities.

**Source 27:** ArXiv - Neural Brain Framework (2025)
[Neural Brain: A Neuroscience-inspired Framework for Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/html/2505.07634v1)

The Neural Brain framework synthesizes principles from neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning, integrating multimodal active sensing, closed-loop perception-cognition-action cycles, neuroplasticity-driven memory systems, and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware-software co-design.

## 5. Cognitive Load Theory and AI Interaction

### 5.1 Cognitive Load in AI Systems (2024)

**Source 28:** PMC - Challenging Cognitive Load Theory with AI (2024)
[Challenging Cognitive Load Theory: The Role of Educational Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11852728/)

AI-driven adaptive learning systems can optimize cognitive load management by automatically adjusting instructional materials, scaffolding complex concepts, and providing immediate feedback. AI can tailor learning experiences to individual students by adjusting the difficulty and presentation of materials to maintain optimal intrinsic cognitive load, and can streamline information presentation to reduce extraneous cognitive load.

**Source 29:** Discover Education - Enhancing Cognitive Load Theory with AI (2025)
[Enhancing the cognitive load theory and multimedia learning framework with AI insight](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s44217-025-00592-6)

A novel conceptual framework has been proposed that integrates Artificial Intelligence with Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning to enhance learning systems, supporting adaptive cognitive load management, AI-mediated schema creation, and human-AI collaborative learning.

**Source 30:** ACM CHI 2024 - Metacognitive Demands of Generative AI
[The Metacognitive Demands and Opportunities of Generative AI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613904.3642902)

Metacognitionâ€”the psychological ability to monitor and control one's thoughts and behaviorâ€”offers a valuable lens for understanding GenAI usability challenges, as these systems impose metacognitive demands on users, requiring a high degree of metacognitive monitoring and control. Prompting in current GenAI systems imposes high metacognitive demand due to the need for self-awareness of goals, increasing cognitive load.

**Source 31:** ArXiv - AI as Extraherics (September 2024)
[AI as Extraherics: Fostering Higher-order Thinking Skills in Human-AI Interaction](https://arxiv.org/html/2409.09218v2)

Extraheric AI fosters cognitive engagement by posing questions or providing alternative perspectives to users, rather than direct answers, unlike existing human-AI interaction designs which replace or augment human cognition.

**Source 32:** Frontiers in Psychology - Cognitive Paradox of AI in Education (2025)
[The cognitive paradox of AI in education: between enhancement and erosion](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1550621/full)

While AI has shown potential to support human tasks and reduce workloads, concerns have arisen about over-reliance on AI technology, which can lead to deskilling where individuals lose opportunities for cognitive skill maintenance and development.

## 6. Analogies and Metaphors for Understanding AI

### 6.1 Popular Metaphors in 2024

**Source 33:** Leon Furze Blog - AI Metaphors We Live By (July 2024)
[AI Metaphors We Live By: The Language of Artificial Intelligence](https://leonfurze.com/2024/07/19/ai-metaphors-we-live-by-the-language-of-artificial-intelligence/)

Generative AI is frequently compared to a chef that uses knowledge from recipes to create entirely new dishes, with each creation influenced by past knowledge but designed to satisfy a specific request. The iceberg metaphor has been used to explain AI systems, where the visible "tip" represents the interface and outputs we interact with, while the vast hidden "underside" represents the complex architecture, training data, and processes.

**Source 34:** UX Tigers - 4 Metaphors for Working with AI (2024)
[4 Metaphors for Working with AI: Intern, Coworker, Teacher, Coach](https://www.uxtigers.com/post/4-metaphors-work-with-ai)

AI as an eager intern requiring close supervision was a popular metaphor in early 2023 but became limiting in late 2024. By late 2024, experts suggested AI can do much more than being a helpful but error-prone intern, with more fruitful metaphors including coworker, teacher, and coach.

**Source 35:** Institute for Law & AI - AI Policy Metaphors
[AI is likeâ€¦ A literature review of AI metaphors and why they matter for policy](https://law-ai.org/ai-policy-metaphors/)

Framings, metaphors, analogies, and definitions can strongly affect many key stages of the world's response to technology, from developmental pathways to policy agendas to legal frameworks. Explanatory metaphors can make complex or specialized concepts accessible to non-experts, typically as cognitive metaphors that map AI functioning onto human activity.

**Source 36:** Science - The Metaphors of Artificial Intelligence
[The metaphors of artificial intelligence](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt6140)

AI systems are called "agents" that have "knowledge" and "goals"; LLMs are "trained" by receiving "rewards"; "learn" in a "self-supervised" manner by "reading" vast amounts of text; and "reason" using chain of "thought".

**Source 37:** Medium - AI Metaphors: Origins and Impact
['Artificial Intelligence is like a human brain': AI metaphors, their origins and impact](https://alicjahalbryt.medium.com/artificial-intelligence-is-like-a-human-brain-ai-metaphors-their-origins-and-impact-d004b4af9f21)

It is acceptable for experts to use metaphors like "artificial intelligence" because they understand what they're referring to, but it is problematic when presented to laypeople, as what a computer scientist means by "intelligence" is not the same as what a regular person means.

## 7. Dual Process Theory and AI Reasoning

### 7.1 System 1 and System 2 Thinking

**Source 38:** The Decision Lab - System 1 and System 2 Thinking
[System 1 and System 2 Thinking](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/philosophy/system-1-and-system-2-thinking)

System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive, operating with little to no effort, while System 2 is slow, deliberate, and conscious, requiring intentional effort.

**Source 39:** Frontiers in Cognition - Dual-Process Theories for Neuro-Symbolic AI (March 2024)
[Dual-process theories of thought as potential architectures for developing neuro-symbolic AI models](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cognition/articles/10.3389/fcogn.2024.1356941/full)

LLMs face significant limitations when handling structured tasks that rely on symbolic reasoning. This March 2024 paper proposes that dual-process theories could serve as potential architectures for developing neuro-symbolic AI models, addressing these limitations.

**Source 40:** ArXiv - Reasoning on a Spectrum (February 2025)
[Reasoning on a Spectrum: Aligning LLMs to System 1 and System 2 Thinking](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.12470v1)

While dual-process theories have long explained the spectrum of human reasoning, their application in NLP remains underexplored. Computationally light problems demand rapid, intuitive judgments handled by System 1, while heavy problems requiring deliberate analysis are managed by System 2.

**Source 41:** World Economic Forum - Causal AI (2024)
[Causal AI: the revolution uncovering the 'why' of decision-making](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/04/causal-ai-decision-making/)

Generative AI is often compared to the human mind's fast and intuitive thinking, known as "System 1" thinking, while causal AI's reasoning is thought of as our slower and more logical "System 2" thinking.

**Source 42:** PMC - Understanding Dual Process Cognition via Minimum Description Length
[Understanding dual process cognition via the minimum description length principle](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11534269/)

A recent PMC article proposes understanding dual-process cognition through the minimum description length principle, suggesting dual-process structure can enhance adaptive behavior by allowing an agent to minimize the description length of its own behavior.

## 8. Cognitive Biases in AI and Human Decision-Making

### 8.1 AI Replication of Human Biases (2024)

**Source 43:** ScienceDirect - AI and Human Cognitive Bias Similarities (2025)
[Artificial intelligence and human decision making: Exploring similarities in cognitive bias](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949882125000222)

In almost half of the scenarios examined in a new study, ChatGPT exhibited many of the most common human decision-making biases. The study tested OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across 18 well-known cognitive biases and found that despite being "impressively consistent" in their reasoning, they're far from immune to human-like flaws.

**Source 44:** Live Science - AI Overconfidence and Bias (2024)
[AI is just as overconfident and biased as humans can be, study shows](https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-is-just-as-overconfident-and-biased-as-humans-can-be-study-shows)

Irrational tendencies â€” including the hot hand, base-rate neglect and sunk cost fallacy â€” commonly show up in AI systems. The study examined common human biases, including risk aversion, overconfidence and the endowment effect. Interestingly, in the confirmation bias task, GPT-4 always gave biased responses and showed a more pronounced tendency for the hot-hand fallacy than GPT 3.5.

**Source 45:** ArXiv - Beyond Isolation: Interactionist Perspective on Bias (2024)
[Beyond Isolation: Towards an Interactionist Perspective on Human Cognitive Bias and AI Bias](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.18759v1)

When biased humans interact with biased AI, the effects of their biases may compound and alter cognition and decision-making in unexpected ways.

**Source 46:** ACM Proceedings - Deciding Fast and Slow (2022)
[Deciding Fast and Slow: The Role of Cognitive Biases in AI-assisted Decision-making](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3512930)

ChatGPT's human-like biases come from training data that contains the cognitive biases and heuristics humans exhibit, with those tendencies reinforced during fine-tuning, especially when human feedback further favors plausible responses over rational ones.

**Source 47:** Nature Scientific Reports - Humans Inherit AI Biases (2023)
[Humans inherit artificial intelligence biases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-42384-8)

Research shows when participants assisted by AI moved on to perform tasks without assistance, they made the same errors as the AI had made during the previous phase, with participants' responses mimicking AI bias even when the AI was no longer making suggestions, providing evidence of human inheritance of AI bias. A 2024 UCL study found AI not only learns human biases but exacerbates them, creating a dangerous feedback loop.

## 9. Theory of Mind and Social Cognition in AI

### 9.1 Theory of Mind in AI Systems (2024)

**Source 48:** PMC - Knowing Me, Knowing You: Theory of Mind in AI
[Knowing me, knowing you: theory of mind in AI](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7253617/)

Theory of mind (ToM) is a key component of human cognition and refers to the ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions, to oneself and others, and to use that information to understand and predict behaviour.

**Source 49:** IBM Research - Theory of Mind in Human-AI Interaction (2024)
[Theory of Mind in Human-AI Interaction for CHI 2024](https://research.ibm.com/publications/theory-of-mind-in-human-ai-interaction)

Given the fundamental role of ToM in human social interactions, many researchers have been working on methods and techniques to equip AI with an equivalent of human ToM capability to build highly socially intelligent AI. A workshop was held in conjunction with ACM CHI 2024, May 11-16 in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA specifically focused on Theory of Mind in Human-AI Interaction.

**Source 50:** Frontiers in Robotics and AI - Computational Model for Higher Orders of ToM (October 2024)
[Towards a computational model for higher orders of Theory of Mind in social agents](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai/articles/10.3389/frobt.2024.1468756/full)

Research on computational models for higher orders of Theory of Mind in social agents was published in October 2024, addressing how artificial tools, to be effective in these societies, should somehow adopt a social interaction perspective that is closer to the human one.

**Source 51:** Frontiers in AI - Theory of Mind and Preference Learning Review (2022)
[Theory of Mind and Preference Learning at the Interface of Cognitive Science, Neuroscience, and AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.778852/full)

In the context of AI, ToM enables machines to comprehend, predict, and respond to the mental states of humans and other AI agents, thereby enhancing their social intelligence. This is particularly important for human-robot interaction applications such as social robotics, virtual assistants, and autonomous vehicles.

## 10. Distributed Cognition and Extended Mind

### 10.1 Extended Mind Theory and AI (2024)

**Source 52:** Communications of the ACM - Can AI Expand the Human Mind?
[Can AI Expand the Human Mind?](https://cacm.acm.org/news/can-ai-expand-the-human-mind/)

A novel concept called "System 0" has been proposed by Riva and colleagues, which describes AI as "an artificial, non-biological underlying layer of distributed intelligence that interacts with and augments both intuitive and analytical thinking processes." This concept builds on the extended mind theory proposed in 1998 by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, which suggests that objects outside of the body can function as part of the human mind.

**Source 53:** Frontiers in AI - Supporting Cognition with Modern Technology (2022)
[Supporting Cognition With Modern Technology: Distributed Cognition Today and in an AI-Enhanced Future](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.908261/full)

AI-technologies such as smart speakers can be used to easily store appointments, take notes, retrieve knowledge, or perform cognitive tasks, potentially becoming the "future" of distributed cognition by replacing classical offloading tools. However, researchers note concerns about both benefits and potential long-term impacts on human cognitive abilities.

**Source 54:** ArXiv - Distributed Cognition for AI-Supported Remote Operations (2024)
[Distributed Cognition for AI-supported Remote Operations: Challenges and Research Directions](https://arxiv.org/html/2504.14996v1)

In remote operations, AI is increasingly acting as a more autonomous agent, making decisions where immediate human oversight is not feasible, which challenges traditional models of team cognition that assume humans are the primary agents responsible for coordination.

**Source 55:** Nature - Human-AI Collaboration in Hybrid Intelligence (2025)
[Examining humanâ€“AI collaboration in hybrid intelligence learning environments: insight from the Synergy Degree Model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-05097-z)

Research published in 2024-2025 emphasizes that combining both human and AI intelligences in hybrid systems is critical for extending human cognition. A human-AI synergy degree model (HAI-SDM) has been proposed to understand and optimize the synergistic effect of human-AI collaboration in hybrid intelligence learning environments.
